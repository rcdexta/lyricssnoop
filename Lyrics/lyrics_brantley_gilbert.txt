[u"Saturday night my first high school dance
Showin' up late in my sundays best
Seen you before ahh but not in that dress
The dj's last song and I lost the dare
So with my heart and my pride on the line
I asked you to dance for our first time right there

Holding hands in the hall
All night wait for your call it's 2 am and were still on the phone
Hanging out at the mall oh that old picture show
I reach for your lips girl first taste of love
That old ford truck was your daddy's worst fear
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Grand daddy used to take me
Down town to the kinneys
That's where all the old men go to reminisce
Ramble on about history dust off some old stories
Look back at the life they've come to miss
I swear sometimes I can almost see
A picture of this small town back in 1943
Everything's black and white
And there's dirt on the street
It don't look at all what I'm seein' today

Riding around
What's left of a small town
Makin' my rounds
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'I had a buddy come down \'round last July
Called me when he crossed the Mason-Dixon Line
Said he was headed down south and looking for a real good time

I said, "man come on I got a place in mind."
We pulled up at bar right off the Georgia line.
Walked in man his eyes got wide
And when his jaw hit the floor, all I could do was smile.

He said, "man, we got some pretty women up north
But I ain\'t never seen nothing like this."
I said, "man, these here ain\'t ordanary women.
We call these grits."

Shes a product of being raised in the country.
She knows her roots and works hard for her money.
A southern draw with dark tan legs.
Aint nothin\' like a woman southern born and bred.
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"She comes home late at night
Kicks her high-heels off and sighs
Lays down on the bed

She said it's been a long day at work
I couldn't wait til I got home
Just to be with you again

Lord I love just to watch her sleeping
Yeah I just pull the covers up and wonder what she's dreaming

When she's wrapped up with her t-shirt on
Got the lights turned way down low
Radio's got her favorite song on
And man she's singing right along
Let your hair down
Baby let it fall
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I found a box of memories,
Read a letter,
Dropped a tear where you signed your name,
And turning the page,
Smearing the ink into Love Always

Girl, I always start this way a
Nd then I end up in a bottle screaming out your name,
Punching the walls, carrying on like I've gone insane,

And in the mirror,
I can see the man who just shook his head with no remorse,
Watching an angel cry her tears,
Stepping over my beers as you walked out the door.

And there ain't nothing like a memory,
When it's coming on strong like a hurricane.
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Yeah, I worked all week.
Cleaned up, clean cut, and clean shaved.
Get the cover off the \u201968.
Fire it up, and let them horses sing.
A little pretty thing.
A little tan-legged Georgia dream.
She\u2019s a rockin\u2019 them holey jeans.
Baby, what you got goin\u2019 on Saturday?
You know, words got it, there\u2019s gonna be a party,
Out of town about half a mile.
Four wheel drives and big mud tires.
Muscadine wine

Oh baby, you can find me.
In the back of a Ford truck tailgate.
Sittin\u2019 \u2018round watchin\u2019 all these pretty things.
Gettin\u2019 down in that Georgia clay.
And I\u2019ll find peace.
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink.
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"I set out one night in the fast lane bound for freedom
In a truck that daddy bought me
And money mom had saved for school

I laid down all my books and picked up the drinking
Hell I let 'em down
When I gave up like a fool

And one reckless night just lookin' for my whiskey
I found a bible mama gave me and read a while
I read a story 'bout a man who lived just like me
Then finally ate his pride and came runnin' home

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'It\u2019s all around town
Here\u2019s ten cents for mistakes he\u2019s made
It\u2019s all word of mouth
Oh but they say that\u2019s the price you pay
When you\u2019re in with the wrong crowd
Oh look at the mess you\u2019ve made
Starring you down, every time you show your face

Ah to hell with all the small town small talk I\u2019ve had enough
It ain\u2019t their place to judge
Man I\u2019m giving up
And I said if you can\u2019t live it down
Might as well live it up
You live and you learn man
The worlds going to turn, ain\u2019t going to stop you
And I said if you can\u2019t live it down
Might as well live it up
Yeah forgiveness is yours in the hands of the Lord
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"This city's looking like a ghost town
All the stores downtown they've been closing down
Yeah, the only lights that shine for miles
Are lighting up the sky above memorial drive

And if you want a seat you better come on down
'Cause when the band fires up that old glory sound
This is the moment we've all been waiting for
Lining them up, and the whistle blows

This ain't no game around here
It's more like religion
We've built this thing 'round here
A football tradition
So everybody get up
And feast your eyes
On the highlight of small town life
It's Friday night
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Grew up one state North of Kentucky
A Family far from rollin' in the money
7 brothers and sisters to feed and love
Granddaddy said she kept her eyes on the sky,
Watching all the little birds fly
Staring at heaven like her lost home
None of her dreams held fame and fortune
She wanted a husband and children that loved her

Spreading' her wings her feet left ground In Indian
Driving down south just to marry my daddy
Leaving the life she'd known and loved behind
She never cussed or drank, kept food on the table
Hell, I kept her on her knees in prayer
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"So man you think you wanna run whiskey
Well roll with me but you better listen good and clear
If you got a badge or a big mouth brother you ain't got no business here
Fool, this here is moonshine still you can smell that whiskey burn
This is how the big dogs run, boy you're ridin shotgun
Buckle up and lets have some fun

Ridin 95 down the highway, sideways, runnin from ol' John Law
Booze in the boot, move it over Bo Duke make room for a real outlaw
Duct tape on that license plate, a 6 gun in the dash
Thunder in the hood, heaven from a still, lightning in a jar
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Growing up I was always mama's angel,
Never thought I'd ever fall from grace.
I was taught to walk with God and run from trouble,
But I ran with a crowd that was bound to change my ways.

Yeah I was proud to be in the bad news crowd,
The one my mama warned me about,
The closest thing to hell she's ever raised.
But when I look back on those days,
I know I'd never change a thing.
I made mistakes that paved the way for the man I am today,
I'm proud of 'em all,
And I had a ball,
Bending the rules and breaking the law.

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Mamma, she's still got that picture
Of me and Katie on home coming night
She looked pretty in that fancy dress
But that girl was a barefoot, blue jean princess

A hand full of rocks and daddy's pine ladder
Sure did come in handy
For a teenage boy thinking all that mattered
Was a kiss that taste like candy

Back in the day we were wild and free
She was my dashboard drummer
Butterflies in the backseat
Little footprints on my window

Parking my Chevy by the riverside
Four letters in a heart carved in a pine
A little sun dress laying up there on the bank
While the water washed our innocence away
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'She says, "Look, baby, I\'m a rock star"
Grabs my old guitar
Playing it upside down
Dancing \'round in front of our TV

I can\'t see the ballgame
So I just wave my lighter around and say
"Yeah, rock on, baby
I\'d rather watch you anyway"

"But when you\'re done can I come backstage
And get you to sign your name
On that Zeppelin shirt of mine you\'re wearing?
I\'ll never wash that thing again"

Yeah, and she\'s my kind of crazy
The little games she plays
Lord, they never get old
She\'s too cute to get on my last nerve
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'Welcome to the home of a hillbilly
Yeah baby
It\u2019s a land of barbed wire, moonshine, whiskey
Park your car before you get it stuck
Go on grab you a beer
And get on up in the truck
It\u2019s going down tonight
It\u2019s all on me
It\u2019s BYOB, and I got all we need
Yeah boy I\u2019m bout to show me a city slicker
How to kick it in the sticks with the critters down on

Our side of a barbed wire
Money grows in rows
And if it don\u2019t you\u2019ve gone broke
So we
We hang out by the bon fire
Just some good ole boys having a dang good time
We crank it up down here
We get loud down here
Throwin down in the dirty dirty south down here
Be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
Jocks and bikers they all came to kick it in the sticks

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"There's a live oak tree
You can still see off old 129
You can see the scars, its missing bark
Where it stopped my truck that night

They say I took a swing at my best friend
For trying to take my keys
Next thing I knew I was upside down
Thinking this is it for me

When you see life flash before your eyes
The good, the bad, the wrong, the right
Fade into a bright white light
Shining down on you

You're hanging on by a thread
Wondering which ones your last breath
Knowing there's so much you've left to do
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Amy\'s got the letters I wrote
My picture in a frame
She\'s had a year to let go
She\'s still wearing my ring

It hasn\'t left her finger
Since the night that I proposed
When I promised her forever
Before I took her home

But I never made it home that night
A part of her died too
I watched her losing her mind
And there\'s nothing I can do, oh

Sometimes she goes crazy
Screaming out my name
Saying, "Baby, please come and save me"
I wish she knew I\'d do anything

To kiss the tears right off her face
Tell her everything\'s okay
Feel her heartbeat next to mine
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Workin' spittin' huntin' and fishin'
Stone cold country by the grace of God

I was gasin' up the other day
And an ol' boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought of good lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile

Country must be country wide
In every state
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Back in the good old days
Knew how to brawl
I'm talking real gunslingers
I'm talking real outlaws

They'd saddle up and ride on into town
When it was high noon in them old saloons
You knew what was going down

They took it outside, took it outside
It was man to man, it's toe to toe
You know they had to go

Well, nobody's gonna break it up
Not until you've had enough
And if you think you've got the guts
Then let's take it outside

Well, if you think your man enough
You really wanna knuckle up
If you wanna shed a little blood
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Look at them boys in the back of that truck
Somebody ought to jerk a knot in their butts
Out riding around like they own this town
That racket turned all the way up

It's too early for school to let out
The Pastor's boy just threw a cigarette out
I sure hope there ain't beer in them cups
'Cause our star quarterback's turning them up

Them boys don't know one thing about life
True love and trouble, struggle and strife
They think it's all just fun and games
Like laws and rules and balls and chains

Treating little girls like hearts don't break
Treating old men like hands don't shake
I pray it's just a phase they're going through
Yeah, but what are we gonna do with them boys?

You've got a sinner down on his knees
It had to be hell on an angel
