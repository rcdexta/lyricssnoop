Go around this roundabout

Take me to your best friend's house

Don't...

Why don't you fill me up?
All these reasons too hard to explain
So I'll take you up my dear,
We got it all right here
Here is now and now is where I wanna be
Alora si, you belong to me

Up, up in the air
And I run around, round, round, round this down town 
and act like I don't care.

You don't need to explain if everything's changed
Just know I'm just like you.

So I pull the switch, the switch, the switch inside my head.
And I see black, black, green, and brown, brown, brown and blue, yellow, violets, red.
And suddenly a light appears inside my brain
And I think of my ways, I think of my days and know that I have changed.

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad.
It really ain't that bad.

And we're all on our way to the beach.
And everyone keeps laughing at the those we are passing,
as we're sucking down that bonnie, bonnie weed.

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

And we're rolling up to sand
Take your shoes off, man
We are skinny dipping underneath the sea
And it's a chicken fight (plan?)
Throw your dukes up, (Lamb?)
We are splashing in the water to the beat.

I\u2019ve been sleeping in a bus this thrust singing low,low,low

That was probably a lie for the sub inconscious state of mind
Rush, rush rush for the go
Don\u2019t scateer too much
I\u2019ll skip a count down
Fish scales falling below
I\u2019m falling for love

Reason, reason, reason,
Don\u2019t... love go!

Crossing the street on passionate gates
Billys a looker he's from upstate
He ran into Betty and he took her on a date

And it's a sunny day, we were goin, on a holiday
And it's okaaaaaaay, all that's left for me is glitter in our sleep
But don't you wait (don't you wait)

You can make a choice by seeing where the wind blows,
You can watch me sleeping and I can watch you dreaming,
You can change the channel and I can change the feeling.

One, two
One, two, three, four

Call my name, call my name, call my name out
You can find the key and I can find the way out
Honestly, tell me, tell me what you like
I can sit awake from midnight to daylight
You can watch me sleeping and I can watch you dreaming
You can the change the channel and I can change the feeling.

Of feeling so alone and growing old
