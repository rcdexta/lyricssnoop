[u"Something about a truck in a farmer's field
A no trespass sign, you got time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal
Something about a truck in a farmer's field

Something about beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
Something about beer sitting on ice

Something about a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field, will make a boy a man

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way
Love's in the air tonight
Bet you could make this ol' boy stay
Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way
Hey pretty girl, can I have this dance
And the next one after that
Gonna make your mind there's a real good chance
Hey pretty girl, can I have this chance

Hey pretty girl, it feels so right
Just like it's meant to be
All wrapped up in my arms so tight
Hey pretty girl, it feels so right
