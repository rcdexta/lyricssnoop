[u"Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin'?

She snuck out one night an' met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out a-wavin' that 12-guage
We tore out the drive, he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late

'Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
An' I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss
Man, just gotta get goin', where the night might lead

I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'?
What was I thinkin'?

By the county line, the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road an' kicked it in four-wheel
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"That old picture frame keeps hangin' round
'Cause I ain't ready yet to take it down
But every now and then I'll slam the door
Shake it loose and she'll hit the floor

But I can't throw a good thing away
I wish it would break

And I swear my truck's got a haunted radio
'Cause I hear you in every song
But I know what the silence makes me do
So I keep givin' those buttons more abuse

And I wonder how much punchin', it can take
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I'm gonna build a fire in the middle of July
Burn your pictures and go for a drive
Down to the river and watch the ink from your love letters fade
Come back home turn that old mattress over
Pour out the whiskey, try wakin' up sober
Gonna change it all tonight, gonna do whatever it takes

Yeah, 'cause I've lost weight and I've lost hair
And I don't intend to ever go back there
Drinkin' and a thinkin' 'bout a love that just wasn't true
And there's a good chance I'll end up insane
Without enough sense to come in from the rain
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Pullin' into the fast lane
On the leavin' side of town
Just me and the dreams I've left undone
There's a whole lot of roads
That I could point this Chevy down
But I can only think of one

On this river concrete slab
A man could drive for days
And let his imagination run
There's time for a million memories along the way
But I can only think of one
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I learned how to write it
When I first started school
Some bully didn't like it,
He said it didn't sound too cool
So I had to hit him
And all I said when the blood came
It's my last name

Grandpa took it off to Europe
To fight the Germans in the war
It came back on some dog tags
Nobody wears no more
It's written on a headsone
In the field where he was slain
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things

And barstools are there when you can't walk
And I'll always make a waitress my best friend
Until the music stops and closin time begins

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Midnight, stop light, happens every time pretty girl in a car
No resemblance what so ever I wonder how you are
Constant question pounding in my brain
Is anybody loving you these days?

Lonesome pillow, sun come yellow I reach across the bed
Should be hurried, workin', worries I lie there instead
With the thought that's driving me insane
Is anybody loving you these days?
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Take your suitcase and take your heart
Take a train to the boulevard
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
You can try to lose yourself downtown
You can burn all your bridges down
My love will follow you,
Yeah, my love will follow you

Chorus:
My love will follow you
Down every highway or your soul
You can leave me far behind

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"It's strange to hear your voice
I did not expect for you to call
You wonder how I'm doing
How I'm holding up since you did me wrong

Well, how am I doing since you did what you've done to me?
I can't lie, I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you d-d-done to me

Well, now wait one minute
I failed to mention those tears I cried were tears of joy
Because it was no fun there under your thumb and now that we're done
I'm getting right, every night with every single, every lovin' girl in sight
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Every day I swim an ocean
Fightin? your memory like endless waves
I've surrendered to the truth, I'll always love you
But I know someday
I'm gonna reach the banks of a distant shore
Where I won't miss you anymore

Once in a while I'll ride the river
Of whiskey wishes from an old shot glass
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"If lonesome was money I'd be set for life
I'd be swimmin in riches instead of tears I've cried
The blues would be worth a whole lot of green
You'd never hear one complaint from me
If lonesome was money I'd be set for life

If lonesome was a woman I'd never be alone
I'd always have someone here to love me and to hold
I'd leave misery's clutches and find love's embrace
This frown you see a smile would replace
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I know things haven't gone like you planned
And for that I'm partly to blame
You didn't want to fall in love not yet
Cause you've still got so many dreams to chase

And love is a double edged sword
It lets you walk though life feeling content
But that's a feeling you say you can't afford
And you'd be better off bein lonely again

But please don't leave me
Leave me in love
Before you walk away break my heart
Let me give you up
If you need your freedom
...

They come from Kentucky, Mississippi and Alabam
Way down in Texas from all over this land
Each one has a dream and a thousand different goals
But the one that they all share is that midnight radio

Chorus
They're gonna be big stars in big cars and wear nudie suits
Featured on the Opry in rhinestone boots
They'll be ridin on a rainbow to a wall hung with gold
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"(Ryan McCord / Dierks Bentley)

I never thought I'd see the day
That she'd set me free
Cause you know that little ring on my finger
Always felt like a ball and chain to me

All those threats I made about leavin
Suddenly became reality
She released me from my death row sentence
And said we'll sign the final papers in a week

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"There's things in my life
That I've been missin'
The touch of a woman
And lovin' after dark

Come here lately
The woman I've been kissin'
She comes from Kentucky boys
And she don't have a heart

Bartender, he don't mind
He just sets 'em up the same
I ain't been sober since it's over

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"(Dierks Bentley)

I wake up every morning lonesome out of my mind
Reach across my bed what do I find
Sometimes a pillow sometimes a warm body
But they both leave me cold and feeling so empty

Chorus
I need to find the right one right away
I can't keep goin on livin this way
Each night I go out I'm just diggin deeper in my grave
I wonder if I'm ever gonna find

When the autumn wind blows, it cuts right to my soul
And pulls my roots out of the ground

Lonesome why do you love me you won't leave me
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"(Jason Carter / Scott Boyd / Dierks Bentley)

It's dark outside my window and cold without you near
I keep thinkin back on the times when you were mine
But rings and dreams don't matter cause I know you're with him tonight
And you've already left without a fight

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"(Mark Ward)

Called you up about an hour ago
No one answered guess you weren't home
Since you left I've had a lot of time to think

Been a month of Mondays since I took a drink
Poured what I had stashed down the kitchen sink
Bein angry it ain't no way to live
Takin more than I'll ever give
I only wish this pain would go away

Chorus
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"She never knew my name
Least not the one my Daddy gave me
I took off the way I came
Moonlight reflecting off the chrome
She didn't want my story, so I didn't have to lie
If I loved her it was only for a night

Chorus:
Living life on the run
You can't give your heart to no one
Your only friend is the setting sun
I didn't do what they said I done
I gotta stay one step ahead
Or one of these days I'm gonna wake up dead
Dropped in my tracks by a bullet from a lawman's gun
Oh, you can't rest a minute
When you're living life on the run
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Hey girl, what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thing,
But I sure do like your style,
And I can see you came to rock
In your blue jeans and white tank top;
Man that look drives me wild

And it's hey now here we go
DJ don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor
Gotta make them want to come back for more.
Been here since the sun went down,
Be here when it comes back around
Worked all week it's time to play
Gonna get a little bit sideways...
Sideways

Ain't no need to fight
Y'all take that redneck stuff outside
That's what parking lots are for.
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the Cracker Jack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo

She wants to wear my shirt to bed
She wants to make every stray a pet
And drive around in my truck with no place to go

But she needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more

Her real desire
Is to know I'd walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Girl I've been waitin on this long hard day to get over
So i can rest my head right here on your shoulder
I just wanna lay here and feel you breathe
Listen to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And see where it leads...

We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
I wanna make you close your eyes... oh yeah...

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Here she comes down the road
Rattling the gravel with the radio
Kicking out, some loud honky tonk song

Here we go, buckle up
Put us both together in a pickup truck
Gonna be memories all night long

Might get wild I know
But here she comes, here we go

Ready or not
When she pulls the trigger I'm a load of buckshot
One little kiss
It's a match to the fuse, the last bell at school
A kick to the bull at the rodeo
Here she comes, here we go!

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"All the noise and the voices are screamin'
What they have to say
And the headlines and sound bytes are givin' me
Demons to hate
And the man on TV
He tells me it's ugly
But if you ask me

It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world

There's tears and there's fears and there's losses and crosses to bear
And sometimes the best we can do is just to whisper a prayer
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You can cry, cry, cry like the rain
Ocean full of tears won't drown the pain
Take all your whiskey, pour it down the drain
Ain't nothin' gonna make you feel better
Oooh, she's a little heartwrecker
Oooh, she's a little heartwrecker

You can beg, beg, beg like a dog
Chase her 'round the world, but she'll still be gone
She did you right once, but left you all wrong
Now you're chewin' on a Dear John letter
Oooh, she's a little heartwrecker

She takes a big black ball
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"By now I should've been broken
On the rocks that rise from life's ocean
Just another ship lost at sea

By now I should've been scattered
In the wind of my lonesome travels
Like a thousand dandelion seeds

And I should've come unraveled
At the seams like a well worn sweater
But you hold me together

My hopes should've been shattered
Like a bottle out behind some tavern
From a fight that you had no chance to win
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Life is seen more clearly through our tears
'Cause we all find some faith when we face our fears
When my life's goin' like I want God becomes an after thought
And I start trying to build my heaven here

A better believer would look to the skies
Shout hallelujah with tears in his eyes
Open his heart and start givin' it all away

When I take a hard look at myself
And count my blessings I can't but help
But wonder if there's been some kind of mistake
This life of mine should belong to a better believer
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Pair of boots and a sack of clothes
Free and easy down the road I go
Hangin' memories on the high line poles

Ragweed's rockin' on the radio
Free and easy down the road I go
So I keep rollin' like an old banjo
Free and easy down the road I go

Got a guitar on my back
And I'm standin' on this lonesome railroad track
Train's a comin'
It'll be here 'fore too long

Girl that's the kind of way I'm feelin'
Tryin' to stop your leavin'

Got a pebble

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'That first kiss shook me up
It rattled my cage with a tender touch
Sweet and wild
Girl, I could not get enough

The grass was cool, we lost our minds
Sharing secrets and a bottle of wine
Lazy night, cotton dress
Giving into a warm caress

Sweet and wild
Girl, I could not get enough
Sweet and wild
The taste of your love

The taste of your love

On a bed of sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out

Come a little closer baby

Of everything that stands between us

Wild roses on a river bank

Oh, every mile, a memory
Every song, another scene
From some old movie
Goin' back in time, you and me

Every day, a page turned down
Every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train
Rollin' through my dreams
Every mile, a memory

To the loud devil music show
But I wound up in the snake pit with my best friend

And when the lights came up
We both decided that we? d try our luck
At gettin? back to where the real show was

We were backstage, under-age, hangin? with the drummer
When a big dude attitude grabbed me by the collar
I looked at him and said,? It? s all good, brother"

"I? m with the band, hired on as a local stage hand
The one in charge of the microphone stands"
And the lead singer told me to get the one in his dressin? room
We might even have a beer or two
Don? t worry? bout the backstage pass, man it? s cool

In the middle of the road
Standing there in your rearview
And getting soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
The glow of a brake light.

But your wheels just turn,
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You aint showed it yet
I keep a lookin' for
The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind

Come on lay with me
No better place to be
Our little secrets safe in these trees
'Cause I hear baby it's just understood
What happens in the woods, stays in the woods

You never fail to make me smile
We've never been together
Is just something we talk about

When you gonna come around?
When you gonna come around?

I'm the kind that likes to take it slow
Well, that's just the kind I'd like to get to know
I just wanna get started, I need you to show me how
When you gonna come around?

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Ever since I met you girl, you been on my brain
I can\u2019t think of nothing else but you all night and day
It\u2019s like I got a first class seat up on Ozzy\u2019s train
It\u2019s driving me insane

5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I\u2019m goin\u2019 crazy, thinkin\u2019 \u2018bout you baby
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
I\u2019m goin\u2019 crazy, think I love you baby

I gotta get your number girl, I gotta call you up

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Country roads, old theater marquee signs
Parkin' lots and billboards flyin' by
Spanish moss, little hick town-squares
Wild roses on a river bank
Girl, it's almost like you're there

Oh, every mile, a memory
Every song, another scene
From some old movie
Goin' back in time, you and me

Every day, a page turned down
Every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train
Rollin' through my dreams
Every mile, a memory

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I've been called a rambler
'Cause I keep my eyes on that horizon line
And I've been called a gambler
'Cause I always wanna let my winnin's ride

I've been broke more times than I can count
I've been stuck for days in a lonely town
When my luck ran south

Hey, I might be makin' me a reputation
Of goin' my own way and I can't live it down
Got the throttle wide open, gonna live it up knowin'
In this life you only get one go around
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"It's a long trip alone
Over sand and stones
That lie along the road
That we all must travel down

So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
'Cause it's a long trip alone

It's a short piece of time
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"We were playin' out in Vegas
When this lady pressed her way up to the stage
And I forgot what I was singin'
When she met me with her meet-me-later gaze

And when she threw it on my mic stand
I figured they were probably double D's
That might make for a good story, man
But that don't make it easy loving me

One time I met one of my heroes
And he made me feel real good that I was there
'Cause whatever he was smokin', man
It had me spinnin' circles in my chair

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I left that sun sinkin' west in California
I was supposed to say in LA a few more weeks
But the next time that old sun and I meet up
I'll be a thousand miles east

Fifty dollars and a gas card in my pocket
That I'm thinkin' might already be maxed out
That's just one of those little crazy things
I really didn't stop to think about

'Cause when a man wants to be with a woman
There ain't no way of gettin' there too fast
When you know who you wanna spend
The rest of your life with you wanna start
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Got a guitar
Got a guitar on my back
And I'm standin' on this lonesome railroad track
Train's a comin'
It'll be here 'fore too long
But I don't think I can stop it with a song
Girl that's the kind of way I'm feelin'
Tryin' to stop your leavin'

Got a pebble
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"And girl, I've made a name everybody writes off
An open-road hard case, a honky tonk lost cause
The fate I'm lookin' at, there ain't no way around
A long and lonely path, I'm destined to go down

Yeah, there ain't much of nothin' in me
Left to be saved but baby, I bet
If you could love somebody like me
There might be hope for me yet
A hope for me yet

Always livin' fast, only thinkin' short term
I never could get past a bridge I didn't burn
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I hear people talk of Heaven
And how it's only for the precious few
But in the Book that I've been readin'
Sounds to me like there's a lotta room

So I bet some folks are gonna be surprised
About who makes it to the other side

'Cause in the Heaven I'm headed to
There's a place for preachers, thieves and prostitutes
Saints and soldiers, beggars, kings and renegades
For any soul that ever found amazing grace
Ain't no tellin' who on earth He might include
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Pair of boots and a sack of clothes
Free and easy down the road I go
Hangin' memories on the high line poles
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go

Ragweed's rockin' on the radio
Free and easy down the road I go
So I keep rollin' like an old banjo
Free and easy down the road I go
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I came up through the trenches
Where we only played for tips and alcohol
You find out what you're made of when
There ain't no gold or platinum on the wall
And there's a few more like me
Who ain't afraid of fightin' for the cause

Me and my band of brothers, we got you covered
Out here on the honky tonk front lines
We're loaded up with country music
We ain't afraid to use it
Even if we have to play all night

Well, we ain't no rookies
It's our third tour of duty
But that's all right, yeah, that's all right
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"These old boots still got a lot of ground
they ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles
under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm gonnna settle down
I\u2018ve got news for you
I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

And as long as there's a song
Left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead
Ain't for the faint of heart
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Come a little closer baby
I feel like layin' you down
On a bed of sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out

There ain't nothin' that love can't fix
Girl it's right here at our fingertips
So come a little closer baby
I feel like layin' you down

Come a little closer baby
I feel like lettin' go
Of everything that stands between us

Crumpled up cans and a beat up bag of red man chew
Fix a flat, jonny cash box set
Half a dozen parking Tickets that I aint paid yet

I got my shot gun girl right next to me

[CHORUS:]
Four wheels turnin
Two hearts burnin
We go runnin wild
Gonna make a million
Memories for every hundred

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"I must look just like a fool here
In the middle of the road
Standing there in your rearview
And getting soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
The glow of a brake light.

But your wheels just turn,
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You aint showed it yet
I keep a lookin' for
The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Hey bartender, can I make one special request?
My woman left me so tonight I'll be drinkin' your best

I'm not talkin' about Single Malt, Scotch, Jagermeister or Cuervo Gold
I'll take anything domestic, light and cold

Domestic, light and cold, that's what I'm havin'
Serve me up any old iced down American classic

Pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long
I'll take anything domestic, light and cold

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"The world is cold but I don't care
When you have flowers in your hair
I see color and I hear sound
And good things happen when you're around

I work hard for not much pay
So I can know you'll be okay
'Cause I need to live where love abounds
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Guess you heard I'm doin' well
Struck it rich to hear some folks tell
But I'm still the same old me
Down on easy street

You give your all to find that road
And you lose touch with some people as you go
Promises are hard to keep
Down on easy street

But when I lay down, and you're not there
Girl, I wish I was anywhere

But in this world where the telephone is all I touch
When I'm alone and no one ever really knows
The man inside of me
And up here in this lonely room just a-sippin' wine
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Girl I caught you in your little white lie
Red handed, red handed
You said you had to work tonight
But here you are dancin', slow dancin'

In this honky tonk with someone else
And all you got to say for yourself is so so?
I'm sorry, so?

So, so long bye bye baby
I'll catch you on the flip side maybe, don't you
Slip slide on a tear when you find me gone

Go, go on, cry crybaby
Those tears are gonna drip drop maybe
But you're gonna miss my good love baby
For so so long, so so long
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I'm gonna be a modern day drifter
Get out while I can
Gonna trade in this life I've been livin'
For a pocket full of sand
And a modern day drifter don't have to tell no one his plans

I'm gonna find that long stretch of highway
Where no one knows my name
Where as long as the sky just goes on
And it's never the same
A modern day drifter don't ever complain

Bye-bye

Start a fire pass the shine

Shout your name out in the wind 
Confess my love for you again 
Give you all I got to give 
That's how we live up on the ridge 

Won't you come with me tonight 
Where moonlight drifts into your eyes 
I just want one little kiss 
When we get high up on the ridge 

Hey now honey child

Well I hang my head by the riverside
Burst its banks with the tears I've cried
The ripples roll out to the sea
I wish they was washin' over me

How long are we gonna be ridin'
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door
Will there be any comfort there, senor

There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck
And there's an iron cross still hanging from around her neck

Help me find the road you're on

Draw me a map that leads me back to you

Where I can see your silhouette
I've been throwin' little stones
But I don't believe you've even heard me yet

Today you crossed your heart
And said you'd meet me in the dark
When I called you on the phone
You pretended you weren't home

Hey baby, what do you say
Won't you come on outside tonight
The moon is finally shinin' bright as day
Hey what do you say
Can't you hear the music in the wind

Surprised to see you're still around
You broke my heart, that's history
I'm still alive and you're dead to me

I cried for you six months or more
I gave a heartfelt eulogy
I said goodbye, you're dead to me

It didn't take a gun, didn't take a knife

Where hearts can trust just like a child
A wild thing, it don't need a lot
It just grows on what it's it got
It still grows no matter what

I used to be too hard to care
But till you do, you ain't nowhere
Once I just threw love away
But that fool was yesterday
Now my heart is home to stay

Wild things grow on less than a little
And darling I know it'll be
