At ease, I'd like to welcome the newest no limit soldier
Mr. Snoop D O double G and he brings to the tank
Money, power, respect, leadership
Street knowledge and wisdom

D.P.G., yah D.P.G.
Pop the Champagne
Once you break this of you can't get twisted
So pay attention and listen

Welcome to my world nigga and it's V.I.P
And the bitches and the Bud for free
Welcome to my world nigga and it's V.I.P
And the bitches and the Bud for free

Welcome to my world nigga and it's V.I.P

Welcome to my world nigga and it's V.I.P

Welcome to my world nigga and it's V.I.P

Welcome to this world that you never thought existed
And you got to be a soldier to be enlisted
Listen, I'm gonna take your mind and your body and your soul
On a whole li'l trip, just don't lose your grip

Wait a second, where is the sack?
You don't have to ask no questions just jump in the back
And leave your strap, 'cuz there ain't none of that
Where we goin'? It ain't nuthin' but 808, beats and flauntin'

Niggas showin' niggas love, hoes suckin' dicks
That's how we do it, 'cuz everything is in the mix
Doggy Land, Doggy World, Snoop World whatever
It don't matter 'cuz we 'bout it and homies down to do whatever

Everything is legit, and the bitches the shit
And niggas they give you love 'cuz dey down for it
Now that's just how it goes and all the hoes on me
And everything is V.I.P and that's on D.P.G.

Featuring mia x

Slow down cause i can't take the heat slow down
(slow down baby slow down baby)
It's wicked in these streets
Slow down cause i can't take the heat slow down
(ohhhhhhhhh slow down)
It's wicked in these streets

Snoop:
Life ain't nothing but a big old twist
A lot of times when i'm smoking
I'm doing that just to reminisce
It's funny on how shit be
A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me
But look here, i work hard for all the things i got
And to hang with a nigga's just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
But look here dog, a hoe once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it with rich niggas
Nigga we seven figure niggas
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop niggas in rap
And when we get to spittin' make sure y'all step back
You with that? cause if you ain't clown,
We from the d-o double g, we groupie true, and slow down

Slow down (slow down now) cause i can't take the heat, slow down
(i can't take the heat, i can't take the heat)
It's wicked in these streets

Get your ice, get your cups, 'cus we about to get fucked up in here
Yeah straight up

Twisted off a cup of that 'ole ignat juice
Heated in the seat cup fulla drank
Beatin' up the block in the dark blue tank

Bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause
Diggin' in my draws for dem muthafuckin' laws
Harrassin' a nigga, blastin' a nigga

To fucked up off that G-I and juice
C-I get loose, nigga whatchu wanna do
I got a crew but I choose to roll solo
Especially on Sundays dippin' in my low low

[Incomprehensible] spot for the glock
I ain't fuckin' with the hen dogg so toss out the [Incomprehensible]
Put my shit on three wheels for thrills
I hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real

Rollin down the street with heat

Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Rollin down the street with heat

Well, how ya been? Where ya been and what it look like?
My game trump tight especially when it bump like

Four DPG's gettin' crazy
And No Limit is the label that pays me
Ridin' 'round town layin' game down like Goldie
And I remember what my momma showed me

Told me game recognize game
And stay true to what ya do and don't be ashamed
I got all my game from her sometimes I have to wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I'm a bad muthafucka

I fall to my knees, thank God before I do my thang
I don't know why, I love to gang bang
See life ain't nuthin' but a twist anyway, bitch, anyway
You can say what you wanna say

Just don't get in my way 'cause I'm a mean old
Fiend know, C know and P know, see loc'
We make music for the thugs and the bangers
And the bitches, fuck them R&B singers

She want a nigga with his khackies hangin' real low
In a black rag Sixty-four
Hit it down the street, way clean
Bangin' that real shit nigga like Al Green

It's all right
Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

Take it back to the Afros and the naturals
Cape cutter picks, we slips into the back holes
O.G., my nigger, for real though
Straight up off that East Side, top of the hill, y'all

I'm lookin' at the overview
Thinkin' 'bout '86, damn, I was overdue
Walkin' in the hood, makin' mix tapes
Tryin' to walk up about the hood
While I'm chucking at the hood

Nigger, talk about the hood that I came from
It raised me real crip crazy, what up, oopsy daisy
Demon or a heathen, schemin' while I'm dreamin'
Screamin' to get even, seein' is believin'
And don't you forget that, get it to you, get back
Hit that kick back, three flies one away

Reminisce about the things that my grand mama use to say
"Stay in your own lane, stay on your own
And quick trying to be grown
Day turn to night and play turn to fight"

It's all right
Yeah, I guess my granny was right

To me, some of these suckers'll never get it
Full clip and if I miss it I'ma tip it on the Crip
And DoggHouse in your mouth, now tell me how you livin
Who the villain, you the villain? Nigga Ren is "The Villain"
My homey from the C-P-T, cold chillin
Now as time flies by I see the game gettin mo' reala
As I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it?
I always tend to come widdit
Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it
I'm too young to retire, I'm havin fun wit it
See when you learn what to do with it, I'll be done with it
Come with it
