Pointed at her friend and she said there a tag team

Now who said dreams don't come true
It's like I'm dreaming when I come through

See the south is known for ridin high
Cus they ride high on twenty fo's and they smoke n drive
Everybody wanna know where's Pitbull from, what has Pitbull done?

There's a lick for 50 bricks
Now pause
And think about it
Then pause
Is it really worth it
Then pause, pause
Fuck yeah!

Get da mask, get da gloves
Cut off da lights, pop da gat
Run inside, fire'em up or tie'em up

And upgrade the wind-up
If they don't give up da pies

Ugh

(Verse 1)
He went from a street kid doin regular street things
Straight to a street king
Takin over the city, block by block
Breaking down bricks, servin them rock by rock
He's everything a young gun wanna grow up to be
But if only these young guns could see
That murder, money, and lust is slowly murderin' us
Cuz the drug game ain't what it used to be
So look deeper when they paint you a picture
And try to sell you a dream
Cuz a lot of these drug lords turn to the feds, or turn into fiends
The crack game ain't everything it's cracked up to be
Now that same cat that was a, neighborhood celebrity
Is coppin rocks off the news kids on the block
At the same time tryna school them
But these hoodlums got heads as hard as the rocks that he's doin'
Hustlin's like a drug, it's got withdrawal symptoms
And if you know this, you won't skip fame
But you will gain wisdom, and wisdom gains power
Don't let your life go sour over power

(Chorus)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted

I know how to play with they hearts

I've done some dumb things but for the most
I've played it smart, who cares if you run things?
'Cause I'm as live as 106 and Park

With a bunch of sharks only the strong survive
It's do or die, get it right
