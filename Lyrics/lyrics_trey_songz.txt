Just gotta make it, alright, just gotta make it
Oh no, oh no
Just gotta make it, alright, just gotta make it

Shawty, all I got is a dollar and a dream
Is ya gonna roll wit me?
You see, I've tried a 9 to 5 and it just don't fit me
No, I can get us out the hood and have us livin' good

Ya feel me?
But I ain't leavin' here if you ain't wit me
'Cause girl a suit wit a smile that don't fit me
Taking a bus for some miles is gon' kill me

I'm tryin' to turn it around
Start this thing from the ground
And as long as you're down I know

Looking at you day after day, I know I
Just gotta make it alright I just gotta make it
Just gotta make it
Just to see that smile upon your face I know I
Just gotta make it alright I just gotta make it

Everything I do I do for you and we
Just gotta make it alright just gotta make it
To the top of the world me and my girl we
Just gotta make it alright just gotta make it

Now, baby one day soon you go walk outside
And see a Mercedes and I'm gone give ya the keys
And tell ya 'go shoppin' and buy everything you want
Buy everything you need make sure you get some shit for me

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Hey, ladies
(Hey, ladies)
I know you gotta feel me on this
You see there's something
That's been worrying me

And I need to get it off my chest
See when you got you a good man at home
Don't you do him wrong
'Cause I'ma tell you what he thinking, uh, huh, huh

It's 8: 30, I know my baby kinda worried
I said, I'd be there, said, I'd make it in a hurry
But I ain't even on the way
(I ain't even on the way)

She thinking home is so perfect
(Perfect)
But I guess it's 'cause her vision kinda blurry
(Oh)
She don't realize she do me so dirty
(Oh)
And she don't recognize the things that she say

(Things you say)
Can drive a man so crazy
(Make him wanna leave your ass)
Got one foot outside the door

I can't take it no more
Sometimes I wanna
(Walk away)
(And find another lady)
I do 'cause all the things I been doing for you

Good evening
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out
Hope your flights were safe
Feeling real breezey
Swift like the wind

(Verse One)
It's calling my body
It's calling my soul
It's calling my mind
So girl I gotta go
Baby it's the grind
Yes I had a good time
(Don't get me wrong) You were so good
And I really wish I could
Stay a little bit longer
Love you a little bit stronger
And go a little deeper
Baby with you
But since this thang is calling I
Gotta answer dry your eyes
Girl don't cry
'Cause your making it hard for me

(Chorus)
'Cause I don't want to leave (Ooo girl)
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down (I don't wanna)
I don't want to leave no
But girl I gotta go right now

It\'s still ringing in my ear
You screamin\' "I don\'t care"
And I can see it like it just went down
Me walking out of there
I still see \'em on your face baby
So many tears
And I remember feeling like im bout to explode
I gotta get out of here

[Hook]
It\'s like my sun won\'t shine
It\'s like my ride don\'t roll
It\'s like the only one thing I love
Dont love me no more
It\'s like my right gone wrong
It\'s like my ice gone warm
It\'s like the only one thing I love
Dont love me no more

[Chorus]
If I hadn\'t just slacked up on my pimping
You\'d be here with me
If I\'d a stayed instead of dipping
You\'d be here with me
If I\'d a prayed instead of wishing
You\'d still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won\'t bring you back again

I wish that I could run that back
But in life you can\'t press rewind

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"(Verse One)
Tell me why when you put a camera on a thug
The first thing out of his mouth
Is I wanna thank my mama
And some say that causes drama
But its subliminal
Theres no efforts needed
Its like pouring water on the ground that already seeded
And you know it happens all the time
So Ineed to ask this question

(Chorus)
Why oh why is it hard for dudes to always be around
Tell me how can a boy be a man
Only getting fed from a woman's hands
Tell me what do you think will happen
When you don't come around
Its gonna be hard for a boy to be a man
Only getting fed from a woman's hand

(Verse Two)
Now tell me what turns a boy into a thug
Just as soon as he leave the house
See he don't have a man to give him little rules
So he don't running in and out
...

Ladadadadada 
Whoaaaa
Let me explain how your love has got me feelin
I'm willing to throw away and hang up all the pimpin'
I'm ready to let go of my heart
And give it all to you
For the rest of my life
It's like I cant roll or go with no one else but you babe
No body else can make me feel this way but you may
Be the only one I trust and baby thats wussup
Imma tell the world about it
Imma scream and shout it

Only if I could...

Money on my mind, so these haters in the way
Havin' conversations with that paper every day
I ain't talkin' short bread, girl I'm with that major cake
Plus I spend it, I can't take it when the Lord take me away
With my lighter, with my lighter
Aye CiCi, fill my drink up
Ain't no purple, ain't no pink up in this red cup that I'm fucked up
Starin' at your body, God damn your sexy body
I'm Trey, I came to play, I wonna use you as my hobby girl
Seen so many faces in these unfamiliar cities
Bright skylines, got a nigga kinda dizzy
They tryin' to take my spot, well they gon have to come and get me
My crib is at the top, anybody rollin' with me?

If I could, I would bring the whole 'hood to the top of the world, with me
Here's my world, for free
Tryin' to give you what you came to see, yeah
If I could, I would bring the whole 'hood to the top of the world, with me
Here's my world, for free
Tryin' to give you what you came to see, yeah

You say you're workin' harder and I swear that you're a liar
They swear they hot as me, but they never felt the fire
If you're talkin' money, boy you preachin' to the choir
And I be in her brain, she can't think of nothin' flyer
For my niggas in the 'hood,
Lookin' at these other niggas like, I wish a nigga would
'Cause it ain't all good, if I could I would

Soon as I get through, I'm outta there
And it feels so bad, but it felt so good
Wishin I could care, girl I never could
But then I fell into good love
Didn't let me touch the ground
Now I see it clear that your heart is there
And all these other women they just can't compare

Sex ain't better than love
I done seen it all done done it all

And it ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you

And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you
And now it ain't no way we can be friends

The way it felt, no fakin' it
Maybe we were movin' just a little too fast

Expected you to stay forever, yes, I did
Now your gone
And I'm suppose to find another, no, no
