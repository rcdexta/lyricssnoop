[u"She rolled in from the west
In a summer sun dress
Hotter than the heat in July
With her wind blown hair
It just wasn't fair
The way she was blowin' my mind
Have you ever noticed
Every hurricane gets its name from a girl like this
She's a cat. five kind
Keeps you up at night
Hangin' on to the edge of a kiss

She's a beautiful mess
The kind you love to love
But what happens next
I got a feeling when the sun comes up

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
Little lee-way, little more time
Some kind of radar system
Locked in on love
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you want it too

'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold you hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Well, I've been searching for something true
And my heart says it must be you
I'd love to fall and see it through
But, only if you told me to

Well, I'd run through the desert, I'd walk through rain
Get you into trouble and take all the blame
I'd paint you a picture, write you a song
And I'd do it all over if I did all wrong

I don't wanna steal you away,
Or make you change the things that you believe
I just wanna drink from the words you say,
And be everything you need
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I tear the shrink wrap off,
And put the needle down,
Fill my bedroom up with a Cash song,
And crank it up loud,
Because it makes me feel good,
Got the pedal pecked hard,
And the Mustang drive,
Horses screamin' at me,
Momma prayin' that I'll make it home alive,
But it makes me feel good,
Like sneakin'out late,
Tellin'white lies,
Stealin' one more kiss tonight.

I try my best to behave,
And I can't help feelin' this way,
It's not my fault so don't blame me,
'Cause love makes me
And is it some kind of fiction?
Or the sweetest addiction?
Sowhat if I'm crazy,
'Cause love makes me do it,
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"People know that love is what they want,
They get caught up and then its gone
They can't get back the kiss they lost and
Spend their whole life asking questions,
Not knowing what went wrong

But, then the answers that you know just prove you wrong,
Gotta' have a little faith to fall back on
And then all that you've got left is being strong,
Gotta' find a little faith to fall back on

Didn't treat my girl like she was mine
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I'd love to know just what you're thinkin'
Every little river, runnin' through your mind
You give and you take, you come and you go

You leave me here wonderin' if I'll ever know
How much you care or how much you don't
Whatever you need, whatever you want

If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
If you're gonna be somebody's mistake
If you're gonna be somebody's first time
Somebody's last time, baby, be mine

If you're lookin' to be somebody's, 'just friends'
A little laughin', little lovin'
Never callin' again, that's just fine
If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Be mine, yeah, oh, be mine

I guess that all I'm tryin' to tell ya'
Is a minute with you is better than two without
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Say that you love me, even if it's not true.
And say that this storm is just passing through.
And, baby, tell me you're not leaving.
It's just the rainy season.

The air's getting heavy and we both know why.
So dance one more dance and tell one more lie.
And, baby, let's keep make believing
That it's just the rainy season.

We're taking on water.
And drop after drop we're destroying this house
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"When you try not to look at me
Scared that I'll see you hurting
You're not hiding anything, no
And frankly its got me worried
Nobody knows you better than I do
I keep my promises, I'm fighting for you

You're not alone
I'll listen 'till your tears give out
You're safe and sound, I swear that I won't let you down
What's hurting you I, I feel it too
I mean it when I say
When you cry, I cry with you, with you

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room
Seems like everyone around me is on their honey moon
I'd love to take a pin to a heart shaped balloon
Everybody's got somebody but me

Well I don't know how I landed on this movie set
It's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'
I never would have noticed if we'd never met
But everybody's got somebody but me

And I miss you
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Who wakes you in the morning time, Who calls you every late night
Who comforts you when you\u2019re in need, Who always tries to treat you right
Who gives you all he has to give, Who would dedicate his heart to you
Who fulfills all his promises and who sees the good in you
Tell me whatchya ya gonna do when I\u2019m gone
Oh and where your gonna go when there's nobody home
And who\u2019s gonna love you when you\u2019re all alone
Tell me whatchya gonna do when I\u2019m gone
Yeah whatchya gonna do when I\u2019m gone
I just wanna know
