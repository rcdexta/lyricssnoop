[u"I just remembered that time at the market
Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rode down
Aisle five

You looked behind you
To smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us
If we could leave

Can't remember
What went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me
If you had to

Our love was
Comfortable
And so broken in

I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve
...

", u"Back to you
It always comes around, back to you
I tried to forget you, I tried to stay away
But it's too late

Over you
I'm never over, over you
Something about you
It's just the way you move
The way you move me

Yeahhh I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit every game I play
...

", u"If melody
is my destiny
than what's left of me,
i'll give to you.
and if next to me,
is all that you need to be
would you settle for fantasy,
if it's the best you could do?

can I have my cake?
can i have you too?
would you follow me?
could i ask you to?

would the world between us,
break these ties?
we worked so hard
to realize.
can a postcard say,
what i see in your eyes?
...

", u"violent skies
10 am
falling on my knees again

outside in the underground
proud in the rain

I'm walking a straight line
stepped on all of the cracks this time
I don't care I'm not moving aside
for anyone

outside in the underground
proud in the rain
outside in the underground

", u"{This is a song love song for no one
One, two
One, two, three, four}

Stayin' home alone on a Friday
Flat on the floor lookin' back
On old love
Or lack thereof

After all the crushes are faded
And all my wishful thinkin' is wrong
I'm jaded
I hate it

I'm tired of bein' alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of bein' alone
So hurry up and get here
Get here

Been searchin' all my days just to find you

Though it serves you right
Makes you luckier than I

All the colors in the room have changed
The painting yesterday
Brother I discovered you

We're passing through
It won't be long 'til I walk with you

Tonight I'm down
I'm inside out
Staring at the pictures of the album you forgot about

I read your complaint
You're needin' someone older

To live day by day

While lookin' at me
With the same eyes ever again

So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it

You can cross the line
Whenever you want to
I'm callin' it love soon

Close your mind
And waste some time if you have to
I'm callin' it love soon
It's not about you now, it's what we are

85 in the
Kind of morning that
Lasts all afternoon
I'm just stuck inside the gloom

Four more exits to
My apartment but
I am tempted to
Keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

To take me even higher
Then I'll come through

Testing me, testing me, testing me

Right outside my door

They're tryin to ride it out

again.
I can't take the speed

Don't know how else to say it...
Don't wanna see my parents go.
One generation's length away
from fighting my life out on my own.

Stop this train.

But now her ghost is finally gone

Too many hours in this midnight
Too many corners in my mind

Oh but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

Stood on the corner for a while
To wait for the wind to blow down on me
Hoping it takes with it my old ways
And brings some brand new luck upon me

Ever remembers changing their mind from
The paint on a sign?

Ever breaking rank at all

In how they think it ought to be

And they're not going easily

But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You can neer hit who you're trying for

Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried

One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be awhile

Your body is a wonderland
...

", u'My Stupid Mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see
She was offended
She said "well anyway..."
Just dying for a subject change

Oh, to another social casualty
Score one more for me
How could I forget?
Mama said "think before speaking"
No filter in my head
Oh, what\'s a boy to do
I guess he better find one soon

We bit our lips
She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
...

', u"I'm not alone
I wish I was
Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pains
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to
ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is at all

When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
...

", u"Welcome to the real world
She said to me condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white

Well, I never lived the dream of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
...

", u"Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
Fore we see it you take it

Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'

Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
...

", u"These days, with the world getting colder,
She spends more time sleeping over
Than I planned.

Tonight we're gonna order in,
Drinking wine and watch some cnn.
It's dark I know but then again
It's the brightest thing I got

When I'm covered in rain
When I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
No, I am covered in rain, rain
Firewoods to fire places
Summer snow and fallen places
...

", u"I worry
I weigh three times my body
I worry
I throw my fear around
But this morning, there's a calm I can't explain
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain

Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh

By the time I recognize this moment
This moment will be gone
But I will bend the light pretend
That it somehow lingered on
Well all I got's...

Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh
...

", u"And I don? t know where you went, when you left me but
Says here in the water
You must be gone by now
I can tell somehow

One hand on the trigger of a telephone
Wonderin' when the call comes
Where you say it? s alright
You got your heart right

Maybe I? ll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch? til you come back home
Oh, right
I can? t find a flight

We share the sadness
Split screen sadness

Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight

All you need is love is a lie 'cause
We had a love but we still said goodbye
Now we? re tired, battered fighters

And it stings when it nobody? s fault 'cause there's
...

", u"I'm writing you, to catch you up on places I've been
And you held this letter
Probably got excited
But there's nothing else inside it

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it
When I'm in the mood to lose my way with words

Today, skies are painted colors of a cowboy cliche
And strange how clouds that look
Like mountains in the sky
