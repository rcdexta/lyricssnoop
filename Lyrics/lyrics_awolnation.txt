So you can touch it
You can taste it

and he wants to take your soul.
There's a mad man with a mad plan
and he's dancing at your door. Oh
What to do, oooh

when the walls are built to crumble.
There's a mad man with a mad plan
and he waits for us to stumble.

Oooh, but our eyes are open
yeah, they're really open
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
I say we rob from the rich
and blow down the door.
On to the next
to dance with the poor.
Jump on my shoulders.

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"If you're feeling like I feel
Then run your life like it's a dance floor
And if you need a little heat in your face
That's what I'm here for

If you're chilling in the dark
And you're looking through a telescope
You will see me sipping
On a soul of a new hope

So burn it down, burn it down
So burn it down, burn it down
So burn it down, burn it down
Baby, burn it, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Baby, burn it, burn it down

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I'm running out of faith
Be careful who you tell
She's blackening my name
My army never came
its water under the bridge
be careful who you tell
cause you gotta look her in the eye
and you gotta love your way of life
cause you gotta guilty, filthy soul
don't ya know its out of your control
she's blackening my name
I know you feel the same
its water under the bridge
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Well I met an old man
dying on a train.
No more destination
no more pain.
Well he said
"one thing, before I graduate...
never let your fear decide your fate."

I say ya kill your heroes and
fly, fly, baby don\'t cry.
No need to worry cuz
everybody will die.
Every day we just
go, go, baby don\'t go.
Don\'t you worry we
love you more than you know.

Well the sun one day will
leave us all behind.
