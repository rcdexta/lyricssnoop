[u'My daddy spent his life lookin\' up at the sky
He\'d cuss, kick the dust, sayin\', "Son, it\'s way too dry"
If it clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin\' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our honeys down, we take \'em into town
Start washin\' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Ain\'t nothin\' like a kiss out back in the barn
...

Whistlin' a feel good song
Got the sun on my face, nothin' in my way
So I keep rockin' along

I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

The people downtown are hustlin' around
The weight of the world on their mind
Me, I'm sittin' in the shade soakin' up the day
Watchin' 'em all roll by
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Baby, what are we becoming
It feels just like we're always running
Rollin' through the motions every day
I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know
I just want us back to the way we were before

Chorus:

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I, baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Theres a house fly swimmin in my sweet tea
Hey darling pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter drippin off a biscuit, baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like its finally ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair suckin in swamp air
200 mile marker signs from nowhere
Thats what country is

It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
Its a hideaway bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin caught stealin a first farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap thats never fell in the cotton
Its a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I saw a truck backin' out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messin' with the radio, you had your sun glasses on.
I pulled over cause I couldn't believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, just singing our songs
Everybody round our towns been whisperin'
A tear in your eye says I should have been listenin'

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This bein in the dark
Goodbye's never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"We've been up here in this city
Livin' in the grease and grime
Girl, it's a doggone pity
We ain't been gettin' anytime

I've been preachin' 'bout back home
How it can make you feel so alive
Tell you what we can do
Baby, let's me and you take a little drive

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah, yeah

There ain't no card in your pocket
If we're gonna turn that old gas pump on
It's cash for everythin' around here
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound

You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around and say

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late

Right out of the blue
Every time I see you, every time I see you

Top of the world I'm standing rocking at my best
Then I look like a fool
Every time I see you, every time I see you

You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood

I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Some days you got it all together
You swear you have it figured out
Other days you're stumbling and a wondering
What the hell it's all about
Life's kind of funny like that
Sometimes you're the dog sometimes you're the cat
All you can do is just keep going
And thank God for what you have

Chorus
Keep chuggin' along

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"It took me and four of my buddies
Half the night to pull out my truck
I stood there and proclaimed everybody
It's the last time I'll mess with this mud
The boys they all grinned and two nights from then

I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do, I did it again

I took my first sip of cold beer
And tried not to spit it back up
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I got smoke in my hair
My clothes, thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan

My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club?
Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around

And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in

All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him

You know, I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some Cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid

Yay, I must have did
What all my friends say
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I ain't been doin' too right, since I met her last night
Some kinda burnin' breakfast, lost at work state of mind
We're meetin' here because, she mentioned that she loves
Some kinda sushi, veggie, raw and edgy natural stuff
And I'm feelin' out of place, but baby's on the way

I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy, my hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she's got, got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool and end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Home comin' parade, you were the queen
I was ridin' right behind you with the rest of the team
Saw my ring on your finger as you waved to the crowd
I didn't know a second stringer could ever be so proud

The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream was in the car in front of me

On Wednesday nights, we'd meet at church
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Time is tight and money is short
River\'s up and the weatherman
He\'s calling for another storm

Pressure\'s on, the margins thin
Gotta figure out a fix for this awful fix I\'m in
Oh mama, what am I gonna do?
She said, "Child there\'s only one thing you can do"

Don\'t worry \'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don\'t worry \'bout nothing
Pray about everything, pray about everything

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Verse 1

Down where I born it was heaven on earth.
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt.
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright.
We raised cotton, corn, a little cane, and kids.
You either lived on a farm or wish you did.
Jesus always walked close by our side.
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks.

Verse 2

There's a lot about life you can learn on a bus,
How to lie, how to fight, how to kiss, how to cuss.
The closer we sat to the back, the smarter we got.
We were poor, we were ugly, we were all best friends.
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"T-shirt, blue jeans, don't like much on TV
Caviar and a Triscuit, ain't no red eye gravy on a biscuit
My deep southern drawl makes the conversation crawl
You're gonna have to hang around long enough to hear me out

Some folks ain't happy like they are
Some wanna take things just a little too far

Singers wanna be Hollywood actors
And millionaires wanna ride old farm tractors
I am just what I am, I'm just what you see
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Ridin\' down the road, listening to the radio
You leaned over and you turned it up
You said, "Baby, this is it, the one I wanted you to hear
Don\'t it sound just like us?"

Up \'til then all I\'d ever listened to was
\'A Little Sweet Home\', \'Tuesday\'s Gone\' and \'Workin\' Man Blues\'

This is my first love song
First time I felt the words, first time I sang along
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"You need hands, rough not soft
To come and warm you up, up in that cold hayloft
Let me hold you little darling in my big strong arms
Can't get these kinda muscles anywhere but a farm

Hey, I'm a country man
A city boy can't do the things I can
I can grow my own groceries and salt cure a ham
Hey baby, I'm a country man

I've got a jeep with camouflage seats

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"There's a bonfire burnin'
Got Bocephus blarin' louder than allowed
Out in our neck of the neighborhood
If you wanna see follow me
Over the river and through the woods

When the bugs and the beer start bitin'
There's bound to be some friendly fightin'
Usually little Becky Lee winds up
Jumpin' up on somebody's hood, don't she dance good?
Join the crowd gathered 'round
Over the river and through the woods

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You make me want to
Hold you like a hammock on a summer day
Tell you how I'm gonna take your cares away
You make me want to

You make me want to
Roll down the river, run around the bend
Love you like a story with a happy ending
You make me want to

You know you've got everybody lookin'

Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the tool box, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate
Girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
The DJ spinnin' that country song
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl

Everytime our feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her
lying there, with her wet hair
didn't know what we were doing, but we didnt care

the t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
she kissed me like she meant forever

Over my moon.
And all I know now.

You got your hands up,
You're rocking in my truck.
You got the radio on,
You're singing every song.

I'm slowing loosing hold of everything I got.
You're looking so damn hot.
And I don't know what road we're on,
Or where we've been from starrin' at you.

The marchin' band's warmin' up under the football lights
There's tractor-trailers backed up down by the elevator
Train track grain car will roll in later
Get filled up and head on out in the world

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time
