[u"I need to move, I need to breathe
Shake the things that pull on me
Holding me down, slowing me down
I need to run, I need to fight
Let go of the things that I am holding onto
Maybe I need you

Just open up my eyes so I can see
It's always been there right in front of me

Roads... which one will I take?
There's a world wide open
This world wide open
Marks... which one will I make?
There's a world wide open
This world wide open

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"It's been a long week
I've got a slow leak in my left front tire
I'm sick of where I work
My boss is such a jerk, don't care if I get fired

My back's about to break
No money in the bank
And she don't call me anymore
I'm down to my last drink, it's time to sell my things

And pack my bags and never look back
Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks
And make my getaway

I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down
Leave everybody sleepin' in this sleepy town tonight
At the break of day
I'll be a runaway
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I don't understand why we do
What we do to each other
According to His word we're all born
Sisters and brothers

But we lie and we steal, fight and we kill
Even though we know the way

Why do we go dancing in circles
When we know it never ends?
We come so close to loving each other
And then we go dancing in circles again
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Right now you got it made
Got everybody fooled
Got everything you want
It's all about you
No one's figured out
That all your lies are true

CHORUS:
Hey, whatcha gonna do
When the whole world
Turns around on you
Hey, whatcha gonna say
When the bombs you're
Throwing
Start heading your way
I've tried to be the friend
The friend you've never been
But I'm running out of things
To do
I can't change the way you are
It's up to you, it's up to you

I see you standing there
A rock in your hand
Before you throw that thing
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Some people try to hide
They try to move on
Can't stand the pain of you gone
But baby that's not me
I'd never try to ease the ache that I feel
The pain reminds me how real
This love has come to be

And I'm not running scared
I will stay right where
I gave you my word
That I would be

And I don't want to hurt
But I know I have to feel
I do it to be close to you
Just to keep you real
And I don't want to cry
But tears are part of life
They conquer the impossible
And make you feel alive

Sunset, paints a path across the southern sky.
Headin\' down the dusty highway, there he was in the middle of the road.
And I said "Old man let me help you, I can take you home"

And he said,

[CHORUS]
Son you can\'t imagine the trouble that you been,
This whole world\'s gone crazy, livin\' in sin
We want peace and understandin\', and harmony again,
But you can\'t, can\'t go back,
To where you\'ve never been.

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"You took your heart.
And broke down the wall.
Even though I thought that I had seen it all.
The waters still.
It looks so clear.
Im gonna get lost inside it, I will disappear.
But now I only wanna hide away.

[Chorus]
Don't wake me I'm in deep.
Don't break me I feel weak.
I've tasted now I'm wasted and I can't let go.
Your love is all I wanna know.

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I cover my eyes as the 
Sun's pouring in 
No, I never thought 
Last night would end 
And there's smoke in the house 
I woke up on the couch again 

I got nowhere to go and 
No one to see 
The birds out my window are 
Singing to me 
And I don't know their song 
So I hum along out of key 
And this place sure feels haunted 
I guess I got what I wanted 
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Chorus:
I said slow down--
Slow down and live, my friend
Take time--take time to understand
The things--the things you hope to win
Before--before your journey's end

Slow down--slow down and try to do
The things--the things that's right for you
You know--you know
The soul--the soul
You save could be your own

Albert Abernathy never spent a foolish dime
Rising at the crack of dawn and working overtime
You know, he never told me how much happiness he found
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Ohh

Like a thundercloud without a chance of rain
Like a stretch of sandy beach without the waves
It's like I'm spinning my wheels
Down a lonely interstate...
Me Without You

It's a picture perfect sky without a view
It's an empty seat at a table for two
It's having all the time in the world
And nothing to do...
Me Without You

I've been loving you so long
I'm a leaf lost in the wind
I want to be so strong
But I don't know how to begin

She starts dancing when the stars come out
She ain't your typical preacher's daughter
She'll leave you dreamin' yeah there ain't no doubt

There's a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
She's a little bit of heaven with a wild side
Got a rebel heart a country mile wide, there's a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
A little bit of devil in her angel eyes

Saturday night she's rockin' out by the bonfire
Flirtin' from that tail gate and crankin' up the dial
