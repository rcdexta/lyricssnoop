I flipped off that coach, left that school in the dust
For letting my dreams go bust

But I thank God I ain't what I almost was

...

", u"Only fools would race down Grist Mill Road
Let alone in angry weather
That's what I tell everyone I know
Now that I know better

That's a lesson I wish I would've learned
Without havin' to watch my Mustang burn
Before my best buddy had to wind up hurt
An' his whole life was changed

That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn
The hard way

Only a fool would keep a diamond ring
In a box on the top of his closet
...

", u"I wear a greasy ball-cap
I like my shirt untucked.
I spend Saturday's workin' on my truck.
I don't like to fight but I ain't scared to bleed.
Most don't mess with a guy like me.

'Cause guys like me drink too many beers,
On Friday after work.
My best blue jeans have Skol rings;
We wear our boots to church.
So rough around the edges, it's hard to believe,
That girls like you love guys like me.

...

", u'These four walls of Fort Worth
Are closin\' in on me
My final meter\'s over
An\' they\'re gonna set me free

I can feel the fire\'s a burnin\'
As the devil guards my door
I hit my knees in search of Jesus
On a cold jail house floor

Lord, now I\'m singin\', "Get me out of here"
I see the preacher\'s eyes
As my daughter cries
When they strap me in this chair

Lord, I hope she forgives me
For livin\' my life this way
Tonight I ride the lightning
To my final judgment day

\'Every life owes a debt\'

', u"Never realised how much she brought to the table.
Till I went to sit my cup of coffee where the table used to be.
No cats, no bed, no heirloom antique cradle,
An' no more hope for one day startin' that family.
Bet she's gainin' fast on Memphis with a trailer-load in tow.
Who says you can't take it with you when you go?

'Cause she got away with everything that I had goin';
An' she got away 'fore I could make it all alright.
An' I got away with leavin' what needs said unspoken.
Hell, I even blew the chance I had to say goodbye.
...

", u"There's a little dive on a dead-end road,
Called the Cross-Eyed Cricket Waterin' Hole,
Where you can hear the sound of a steel-guitar,
An' get loud an' rowdy on PBR.
But at the top of every hour, man, you can hear a pin drop,
As ol' Jack drops in a quarter an' plays Merle on the jukebox, an' we stop:

An' tip our hats,
An' raise our glasses of cold, cold beer.
They say country's fadin',
But we're still wavin' that flag around here.
An' when it's time to go, you know you're welcome back,
Where the people pledge allegiance to The Hag.

When the weekend comes an' the weather's clear,
...

", u'You were too bad for a little square town
With your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground
Heard you cussed out mama, pushed daddy around
before you tore off in his car

Here you are running these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the \u2018hood here snowed, but you can\u2019t fool me
We both know who you are

Homeboy, you\u2019re gonna wish one day,
That you were sittin\u2019 on a gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side, ice cold beer on the other
Ain\u2019t no shame in a blue collar forty, 
little house, little kid, little small town story
If you don\u2019t ever do anything else for me,
