[u"You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make up
To cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh

Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart
I tore it apart
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence
And no woman in the world deserves this
But here I am asking you for one more chance

Can we fall, one more time?
Stop the tape and rewind
Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade
Cause there is nobody else

It's gotta be you
Only you
It's gotta be you
Only you

Something\u2019s gotta give now
Cause I\u2019m dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
Cause you've got that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my head

Cause I can't look you in the eyes

And say

When he opens his arms
and holds you close tonight
it just won't feel right
Cause I cant love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down
I might just die inside

would you see me?
would you lay down

And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
