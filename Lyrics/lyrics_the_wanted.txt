If we don't take it on we won't get far

It seems so far away but so close
It's there for us to take when most
Would waste it don't waste it

And we try, and we fail
And we live another day
And we rise like a phoenix
From the flames
And it burns but turns out golden

We loved to dream aloud
With both feet on the ground

", u"She aims a smile with the safety off
And she's not afraid to use it
She holds my gaze just long enough
For me to feel like I'm gonna lose it

And I know that she knows
That I know what she's doing to me
And she knows when she calls
I'll fall for her every time

'Cause I'm wrapped I'm wrapped around
Your perfect little finger
And I'm trapped inside the cell
Of every sound she makes
She is my weakness
She is my weakness

Left, left, left, right, left

Tell me whats going on
I know theres something on your mind
Can you just open up?
Do you feel like i'm not, somebody trying to hurt you
Know i'd never let that happen, Must be out of thier minds

'Cause you are the sunshine that makes my day
And I won't let them take that away, Hey

I'll be your hero whose standing strong
Who will protect you from any fights
And if your battles are pilling on
I will take them on with all my might
Cry my tears on my shoulder

", u"Praying won't do it,
Hating won't do it,
Drinking won't do it,
Fighting won't knock you out,
Of my head.

Hiding won't hide it,
Smiling won't hide it,
Like I ain't tried it,
Everyone's tried it now,
And failed somehow.

So when you gonna let me,
When you gonna let me out,
Out.

And if you know how do you get up from an all time low,
I'm in pieces, 
It seems like peace is,
The only thing I'll ever know,
How do you get up,
Get down.

", u'I feel your heart cry for love,
But you won\'t let me make it right.
You were hurt, but I decided,
That you were worth the fight.
Every night, you lock up,
You won\'t let me come inside.
But the look in your eyes,
As I can turn the tide.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
I can tell you can fit one more.
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
I don\'t care who was there before.

I feel your heart cry for love,
Then you act like there\'s no room.
Room for me, or anyone,
"Don\'t disturb" is all I see.
Close the door, turn the key,
On everything that we could be.
If loneliness would move out,
I\'d fill the vacancy.
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
...

', u"They say that time
Heals everything\xa0
But they don't know you\xa0
And the scars you bring

'Cos you left a jagged hole\xa0
And I can't stand it anymore

If heartache was a physical pain\xa0
I could face it I could face it\xa0
But you're hurting me\xa0
From inside of my head\xa0
I can't take it I can't take it

I'm gonna lose my mind\xa0

", u"You know I never want to hurt you
I don't know why I'd ever want to
Oh oh oh

There's no comfort in another face
So are you gonna let it go to waste
Oh oh oh

I keep on tryin'
But how can I buy in
When they don't compare to you
No oh

I'm running out of patience
Tired of imitations
Looking for someone to
Replace your heart
Everyone I talk to
Is just another not you
Makes me wonder
How we're so far apart
I'm tired of imitations
Running out of patience
Tryin' to replace
Replace your heart

", u"I'm gonna see some friends
From outta state
I've already dreamt that's you
Was supposed to take a while ago
But it fell through
Like all of you Llike all of you

Thought I'd make the drive\xa0
But a free plane ride Is in the air
Just like that my fear of it disappeared\xa0
Like all of you like all of you

And I'm High and Low\xa0
For yesterday\xa0
High and Low For you and I\xa0

It's got my baby in a fever
And I hope it gets the better of you

With this Morricone music
There's no way you can refute it
But girl you ain't got nothing to lose

Aye, aye, aye girl, oh, oh, oh
It's not who you know
When I'm what you know
Aye, aye, aye
Just come and go with me

Aye, aye, aye, girl gone, gone, gone
Don't want a room full of snakes
If the lights are on and
Aye, aye, aye
Just come and go with me

", u"I see you walk away walk away
So why you looking back at me like that like that
If you're not messing with messing with
Me then why you go on and kiss me like that like that
My head is killing me killing me girl
Are you telling me stay or go

If I can't have you
Why won't you let me go
If you don't want me
Say it on the radio
So go on go on go on just play it
Come on come on come on, you'll never say it

That you don't want me
\u2018Cause you can't let me go me go

Even the good can be a curse
Makes it hard to know which road to go down
Knowing too much can get you hurt.

Is it better? Is it worse?
Are we sitting in reverse
It's just like we're going backwards.

I know where I want this to go
Driving fast but let? s go slow
What I don't wanna do is crash nooo.

Just know you're not in this thing alone
There's always a place in me that you can call home
Whenever you feel like we're growing apart
Let's just go back, back, back, back, back to the start.oh

Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough worth fighting for
