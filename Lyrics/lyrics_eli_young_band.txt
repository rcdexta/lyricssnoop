I can still recall your body in the pale white light
When love's not love it sure felt right
Who would have known you were the crazy type.

We were teaching each other how to love
After all it couldn't be that tough
On the bank of the river with the stars above
I learned things I never knew of...

When we were young and wild livin' day to day
Swervin' around every corner tryin' to find our way
Time seemed to stop for us baby didn't it?
When we were innocent

I don't care you can live your life alone
Was only tryin' to show you how to love again
Tried and tried to chip away your heart of stone
Was only tryin' to show you how to love again

And I still think it's me
I still think it's me
I still believe one day you will see
We can't fight it or even deny it
I need every breath you breathe
I still think its me

Had a cool lil\' place we\'d go hide on friday nights,
Get away from the city lights,
Find a lil\' wood and build a fire,
Somebody\'d always bring a couple guitars,
And we\'d take turns singin songs,
And watchin it burn,
We\'d do "Ramblin Man"
"Proud Mary" and " American Band",
We\'d be singin at the top of our lungs,

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs everytime,
Made everybody feel somthin inside,
With the fire down low,
Held your girl real close,
Made you wanna love the one you were with,
Gave you the courage for that first kiss,
It was the love songs,
Always the Love Songs,

Where'd all the love go
I need you to know
I'm singing out to you
Tell me there's something I can do

Radio waves, can you hear me singing out
I've got something to say
Can't you hear I need you now
I'm calling on the two of us so we can be saved
Listen to my radio waves

A good intention from the start
You failed to mention

Can't count on you it doesn't add up
I see we're through and the truth is pretty sober
This is going nowhere enough is enough

Accelerate with your bare feet
Take this corner carefully
It's hard to corner when you can't see

That we're kicking up a cloud of dust
On a bird's eye view of us
I'll be damned if we're gonna rust
In a town I've never thought of much

Gotta throw and go
Gotta make new ground
Leave in a hush
Take what ain't nailed down
Don't trip the wire don't let the neighbors know
By the time the light hits we'll be so far gone
Throw and go

Covered in stickers of her favorite bands
She's got a handful of records that she turns to
When she needs to land
She's a Saturday night parade through the streets
That all eyes come to see including me

She carries memories around like souvenirs down in her pockets
She should have let some go by now but can't seem to drop it
Says forgiveness ain't nothing but a lifeless tire on the shoulder of her soul
That never rolls

For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than Heaven

A little distance and I lost something in between
I've waited forever 
For this to get better.

She said how can I believe in something I can't see or feel with my fingers?
Yeah how can I believe
And I said...

Anytime you think you wanna be my love
That's a reason to do what you're thinkin of
Anytime you think you wanna come on over

I just hoped that road would one day watch you walk right back to me
\u2018Til then I\u2019ll be
Jet black and jealous

And I\u2019ll dare not let \u2018em know that now you\u2019re gone
How I\u2019ll still be a fool for the way we used to be
I just keep laughin\u2019 out loud and play along
As if I traded you for one the way you traded me
\u2018Cause with your beat up bag and your laced up shoes
You walked right out the door
And I hit the floor
Jet black and jealous

And the way I'm feeling right now is strange
I think it's time to make some changes
'Cause right now my outlook has changed

I feel like a dance that's lost it's rhythm
A compass that can't fine it's way
But there's a headlight shinning clearly
Down a gravel road just off the interstate

Take away the mundane
Calling on a new campaign
Starting over now has got a real good ring
And under this circumstance
It's giving me a second chance

I like simple, not complicated,

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a Small Town Kid, driven by rock music,
And some honky-tonk in the mix,
I like whiskey in coke,
A doulbed to the top, shot of cuervo, now and then,
I never ask for a lot, I'll never need much,
A good-lookin lady who can drive my truck,
I'm not afriad to admit, I'm that Small Town Kid,

I sit here in my bed, with you in my head, haunting my mind

We'd sit down and talk, sometimes till three or four o'clock in the morning

I live in misery, haunted by your memory, and the love that I felt
Guess that was not enough, you fell out of love, something you couldn't help

Miles away from my so-called life, I didn't really care,
She took me there...

And you want me to be strong, any less just shows I'm weak,
How'd you turn so cold, where's the girl I used to know,

I never thought that you'd be going,
Now I'm just going through the motions,

Everywhere I go wherever I run

When this world comes crashing

You'll recover, yeah you'll recover

But it took you by surprise when you came out a fool.
You gotta fail a thousand times
Before you see it through.
You gotta spend your last dime
Before you ever make a million.
You gotta know what brought you here
And you gotta lose to persevere.
But it's the way the sun will rise
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I know there something about me
I didn't know
I didn't see
Back when I tend to take for granted
The ones who made a man of me
That kid I was
He had no clue
That he'd make the man standing right here in front of you

I was born my old mans son
My momma's secret weapon
Her loaded gun
From the way I laugh to the way I hold a woman's hand
Everywhere I go wherever I run
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"The heartache hurts and you can't move on
Blue skies fade to a gray sky dawn
Tryin' to find a place in this town
That you don't feel 6 feet under ground
You're so tired, you're so scared
Defeated by the troubles you can't repair

When this world comes crashing
You don't have to rip away
You don't have to give up, no
Let the angels play a sad song
To carry you home
It won't be long you'll discover
You'll recover, yeah you'll recover
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"
I'm a runner that's what I do 
don't be surprised when I run from you 
when you turn around I'll be gone.

I won't leave cuz of something ya said 
nobody will know which way that I Went
Beat ya to the door 
before you get the chance

It ain't the falling in love I'm scared of 
it ain't the moonlight shining in
Your eyes it aint the falling baby 
cuz the fallin I've always liked

I'm good at being lonely 
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"That's The Way

I sit here in my bed, with you in my head, haunting my mind
I think of all we had, all the good and bad and all of the times
We'd sit down and talk, sometimes till three or four o'clock in the morning

I live in misery, haunted by your memory, and the love that I felt
Guess that was not enough, you fell out of love, something you couldn't help
I guess now I see; that's the way it's gotta be

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I saw the sun set low on that skyline
Day was gone I was out of time
As I let her walk out and say goodbye
And I sat there on that street askin' why
I let her drive away...
I let her drive away...

She walked out that door threw that truck in gear
I'm standing there alone drowning in my tears
Watched the tailights as they disappeared
She was gone like I'd always feared
As I let her drive away...
I let her drive away...
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"She walked in dressed in red
Didn't take long to lose my head
All this time I never knew
There were girls with eyes so blue

Certain of herself, she walked around
As if she knew she owned this town
Talking to her I'd have never guessed
End of the night I'd kiss the girl in red

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"when you come down my way
here i'd hope you'd stay
maybe for awhile
not just a day ya
when you come down my way

i haven't seen you in so long
there's a lot to get caught up on
pull up a chair
pour a drink that's strong
i haven't seen you in so long

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Going through the change, when it rains it pours these days
Nothing stays the same, you gotta find new ways
To swim upstream, while you chase your dreams
And in between you keep your sanity

Chorus:
Waiting on life to Level
Waiting on something stable
Maybe soon I'll be able
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I've got the streets memorized,
I see the faces embedded in my mind,
I keep on fightin the urge to go,
I've got nothin in common with the town I've come to know,
(So)

[Chorus]
I am so close now to walkin away,
About to walk a path I've gotta take,
I am packin up, headin out,
Cause I can't sleep I'm dreamin way too loud,
I'm so close now, so close now,
To gettin out,
[End Chorus]

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Highways and Broken Hearts


He never knew their names and never really cared
Lying to himself, he was never just a young kid scared
Living on his own with no one to hold on to
Nowhere to go and nothing to do
But lie awake and pray that one-day
Someone will come his way

Chorus:
All He knows are
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"I've been living in this town, for quite sometime
It's been eighteen years since I crossed that county line
I sold almost everything that was mine
Now I'm leaving town, with nothing but that bottom line

A hundred dollars and a half of a tank of gas
The shirt that's on my back, and an beat up Rangers cap
200 miles to go, who would believe that,
I would go this far, without turning back

Chorus:
So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom Line
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Give me skies of black and blue, the way you make me feel
Give me skies of green and red, cold winds that make it real
Storms are brewing deep within of hurt and loss and pride
It's good to see the world in pain when I take a walk outside

Chorus:
When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try
When it rains, Some people get down, They're sporting a frown, so I fit right in
Yeah, the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way, I'd take the rain
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You've got a heart that's broken and a will that's given up
A cynical mind and a soul that's worn and rough
You're a fighter, no one can get the best of you
Don't let 'em stay to close that's why you play every man for a fool

I don't care you can live your life alone
Was only tryin' to show you how to love again
Tried and tried to chip away your heart of stone
Was only tryin' to show you how to love again
