Is if you weren't here, woah, I don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?

Can't face this focus at heart between me and love

Said "there\'s another," and looked right in my eyes

Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you\'d always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby, oh

But for you I need, I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine

I know I won't be the first one
Giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much
Just somebody to love

Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love

and this world will belong to me

This life can kick you around
