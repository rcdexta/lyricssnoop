I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of my lovin\'
I\'m simply going to drive you crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin\'
I\'m really gonna drive you crazy

[Young Buc]
Im lovin\' how you look in my eyes
Swingin\' them hips when you pass
I\'m visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi
Then go pull up at the afterparty
I think we make a perfect couple
But you think I\'m trouble
Maybe thats the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman"
Think im\'a be chasin\' the chicken head you own somethin\'
Your toes painted hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin\' what you said that you won\'t do
Making decisions shorty good things don\'t last long
Your girlfriend keep showin\' me that thong
Before I head home
Im\'a stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it\'s on (holla at your boy)

Let another girl sit in your throne

Ain\'t in a rush for mainstream
I am the streets, I am gettin\' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard

Gotta go, lemme get the car key
You don\'t want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everythin\' sparkly
Hit \'em on a walkie-talkie

Hit \'em, hit \'em knock, knock
Tell \'em let me in, my name ring bells bitch buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians
Or real, real bad lesbian

Hit \'em wit the Mac, hit \'em wit the Tech 9
Hit \'em wit the Ruger by the intersect sign
Hit \'em wit a Tommy so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep a jimmy in the truck or in the Lamby

Put my whole burrough on my back and I\'m gooda
I don\'t wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up
Used to drink water wit a little bit of sugar

How do you do that shit?

How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo

You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they looking you let me hide
Defend my honour, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But looking back it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lying, know when I'm crying
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I trying, no you ain't lying
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make hoarse from yelling at you
At gettin' at you, pickin' up dishes and throwing them at you
Why are you speaking when no-one asks you

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?

And everyday, we're survivors
So forget the day, it's all about tonight
Act a fool and start a riot, a riot be rebel
Bottles poppin' 'til we can't stand
We keep it rockin' till 6 a.m.
New York to London, over to Japan
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up

We gonna party like, party like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up,

A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a friend

Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become near when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising

I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire

In this very moment I'm king
In this very moment I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring

And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we

Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me

Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of

Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they could think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

So where my dawgs at, Randy
Matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
'Cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi

Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs and the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron

As long as I am in the game, you'll never win
