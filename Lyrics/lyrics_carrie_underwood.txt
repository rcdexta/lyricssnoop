[u'Hey, good girl
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you
What you\u2019re thinkin\u2019 about
You\u2019ll see a good boy
Gonna give you the world
But he\u2019s gonna leave you cryin\u2019
With your heart in the dirt

His lips are dropping honey
But he\u2019ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your loving
Go and throw away the key

Hey good girl
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won\u2019t you open your eyes?
It\u2019s just a matter of time \u2019till you find
He\u2019s no good, girl
No good for you

Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past
Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away

Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife,
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn\u2019t bother to cry
Bye Bye, Bye Bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He\u2019s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

Two black cadillacs, two black cadillacs

And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun,
Slipped away

For you are the stars to me,
You are the light I follow

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
Till I see you again

You were the blanket holding me tight
You were kissing me and the years stood still
You said we don\u2019t have to till I said I will, yeah

We ran in when the thunder came
You told me sugar melts in the rain
Don\u2019t want to watch our love go to waste
So we ran inside for it was too late
Oh I, Oh I\u2019m not trying
Oh I, Oh I, but I can\u2019t stop smiling, yeah

Do you think about me
Like I think about you
Do you think about me
Like I think about you,

His yellow-silk tie

Stood a young pretty bride

Forever changed,

Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named,
Forever changed

She remembers the change in her body

Take off all your makeup girl
shine your light, show the world
don't be shy and don't be scared

Glitter like gold
And you need to know
When nobody ever told you

Mirror Mirror on the wall
Acting like he knows it all
Tells you lies of vanity

Mrs. Johnson said to tell you hi

Thank God for hometowns
And all the love that makes you go round
Thank God for the country lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won\u2019t forget you
Cause when you\u2019re lost in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns

In a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
Caught a glimpse that caught me in my tracks
It took me back
You looked happy
With that little girl up on your shoulders, happy
I know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
Time's been sweet to you

As bad as it was
As bad as it hurts
I thank God I didn't get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you're holding onto someone that you gotta let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah sometimes

Well it wasn't two weeks

Wanda started getting abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red eye midnight flight

There was something in your eyes and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide

Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"One foot on the bus 'bout half past nine
I knew that you were leaving this time
I thought about laying down in its path
Thinking that you might get off for that

I remember that night we laid in bed
Naming all our kids that we hadn't had yet
One for your grandma and one for mine
Said we'd draw straws when it came time

I'll move on, baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Wanna find some boy, rip his heart right out
First man I see, gonna take him down
It ain\x92t the christian thing to do, they say
But someone, somewhere\x92s gotta pay

And if it wasn\x92t for guys like you,
there wouldn\x92t be songs like this
and if you hadn\x92t gone and done me wrong,
I wouldn\x92t go off like this
Yeah, even i\x92m surprised how easy sweet revenge
rolls off my lips
If it wasn\x92t for guys like you,
there wouldn\x92t be songs like this

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad, another school
Another house that'll never be home

When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face

This is my temporary home
It's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home

Mmmmm

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Maybe it's the way that the stars are aligned
That's makin' me feel this way tonight
Maybe it's the words you left unsaid
Maybe it's the stardust in my head

But I wanna tell ya
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah and
I can't wait another minute
Life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time baby

Maybe it's the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill
That's making all the pieces fit
Makin' it all make perfect sense
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I would bet my life like I bet my heart 
That you were the one, baby
I've never been so sure of anything before
You're driving my heart crazy

I can't hold out
I can't hold back now
Like i've done before

Darling look at me 
I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling can't you see
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Standing at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hard wood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can't get it back
Let's face it

For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring rain drops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step and said
I see the way out and I'm gonna' take it

I don't wanna' spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I've let all these years go by
Wasted

Another glass of whisky but it still don't kill the pain
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"18 years had come and gone
For momma they flew by
But for me they drug on and on

We were loadin up that chevy
Both tryin' not to cry
Mama kept on talkin
Puttin off goodbye

Then she took my hand and said
Baby don't forget

(Chorus)
Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
And there's a fifty in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash
Here's a map and here's a bible
If you ever lose your way
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I've never been the kind that you'd call lucky
Always stumblin' around in circles
But I must have stumbled into something
Look at me
Am I really alone with you?

I wake up feeling like my life's worth living
Can't recall when I last felt that way
Guess it must be all this love you're giving
Never knew never knew
It could be like this

But I guess
Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It would been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way to fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was sooo scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Sittin\' up on the roof
Sneakin\' a smoke by the chimney
Checkin\' out the moon and the city lights
He takes off his flannel shirt
And he drapes it around her shoulders
Slides up behind her and holds on tight
And she says, "I don\'t want this night to end
Why does it have to end?"

Tomorrow she\'ll be rollin\' down I-10 Baton Rouge
LSU 18 years in her rear view
He\'s got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy\'s shop, it ain\'t much but it\'s a job
They\'ve been dreadin\' this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"There's some things that I regret, 
Some words I wish had gone unsaid, 
Some starts, 
That had some better endings, 
Been some bad times I've been through, 
Damage I cannot undo, 
Some things, 
I wish I could do all all over again, 
But it don't really matter, 
Life gets that much harder, 
It makes you that much stronger, 
Oh, some pages turned, 
Some bridges burned, 

But there were, 
Lessons learned. 
[CHORUS:]

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes, 
Everyday I wonder how I get through the night, 
Every change, life has thrown me, 
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart, 
I'm grateful, for everytime, 
Some pages turned, 
Some bridges burned,

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Right now he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying
Her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey

Right now, he's probably up behind her
With a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up 4 wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seat
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I was sitting on my doorstep
I hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
But I knew I had to do it
And he wouldn't understand

So hard to see myself without him
I felt a piece of my heart break
But when you're standing at a crossroad
There's a choice you gotta make

I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side

I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when you try to fly
Sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Lately nothing I do ever seems to please you
And maybe turning my back would be that much easier
Cause hurtful words are all that we exchange
But I can\x92t watch you walk away

Can I forget about the way it feels to touch you?
And all about the good times that we\x92ve been through
Could I wake up without you every day?
Would I let you walk away?

No, I can\x92t learn to live without
And I can\x92t give up on us now

(Chorus)
Oh, I know I could say were through
And tell myself I\x92m over you
But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"While we're young and beautiful,
Kiss me like you mean it,
Treat me like I'm special,
Cover me with sweetness,
Cause a time will come,
When we're not so young, and beautiful,

While we're young and beautiful,
Living free and easy,
Here without a worry,
Dancing in our bare feet,
Cause when the summer's done,
We might not be so young, and beautiful.

CHORUS:
It's a crazy, ride,
And baby, you and I,
Are keepin' our sweet love alive.
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful.

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You run and you try
And you're trying to hide
And you're wondering why
You can't get free

He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You get addicted to his love
You wanna get out
But he's holding ya down
'Cause you can't live without
One more touch...

He's a, a good-time cowboy casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise,
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings
That you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Hey, good girl
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you
What you\u2019re thinkin\u2019 about
You\u2019ll see a good boy
Gonna give you the world
But he\u2019s gonna leave you cryin\u2019
With your heart in the dirt

His lips are dropping honey
But he\u2019ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your loving
Go and throw away the key

Hey good girl
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won\u2019t you open your eyes?
It\u2019s just a matter of time \u2019till you find
He\u2019s no good, girl
No good for you
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"You know, I am a dreamer
When my heart is gold
I had to run away high
so I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
Doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song
And you'll never feel left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this long and winding road

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
