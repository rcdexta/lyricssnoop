Guess this means you take back all you said before
Like how much you wanted anyone but me
Said you'd never come back but here you are again

Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life would suck without you

Maybe I was stupid for telling you goodbye
...

", u"Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure you've found it
Slow motion
Sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh, yes they will
They don't want to define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills
Then get cold feet

Oh, no
I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your hand
In my hand
And your heart
On your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

I'll tell them we both just moved on 
When people all stare 
I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk

Pretend I'm okay with it all 
Act like there's nothing wrong

Can I open my eyes? 
Is this as hard as it gets? 
Is this what it feels like to really cry?

Speaking up to you about my emotions has always been hard
But this just can't wait, tonight I feel a little bit brave
So I won't let one more day pass without you explaining what we are

This is gonna sound kind of silly but I couldn't help but notice
The last time you kissed me you kept both eyes open
Baby can you tell me what does that mean?
If you're looking over your shoulder then you don't need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on

Don't let me stop you from doing what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool, take no chance, get over you
No, no don't let me stop you, if you wanna leave baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No don't let me stop you

Every day, every day, every minute
Here comes the emptiness, just can't be lonely you know
Every day, every day, hey, hey

This second chancin's really getting me down
You give and takin' everything I dreamed about
It's time you let me know, let me know, just let go

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was an in between to escape this desperate scene
Where every law reveals the truth
Baby 'cause I all ever wanted, all I ever wanted was you

Restless, waiting for anything,
Tension is thick in the air
Are you gonna lead or follow me?

So come on, come on, come on Now

Lets go,
Lets jump right in,
Scream into the wind,
Feel the fire within,
I cant ignore this burning in my soul,
Come on baby let's go,
We might go fast,
We might go hard,
But I can take it,
I need to know, so come on baby go,

Fever, in my eye,
Starts racing back and forth in my mind,
I feel emotions rush through me,

When the sentimental
Won't stay, won't last
When it's love at first sight
So why are my convictions
Blinded by your spotlight

Can't breathe, can't sleep
Cause the medication
I'll kiss goodbye to my reservations
I know theres other fish out in the sea
Not for me
I want you

If I can't have you
Then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I can't have you
Then all the damage has been done

So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spending my time pleasing you
Why must you keep me underground
Tell me, tell me why you wanna bring me down?
Is it too much to give a damn
When I'm giving you one hundred and ten
Don't blink cause I won't be around

Come on baby let's go,
We might go fast,
We might go hard,

Won't stay, won't last

Blinded by your spotlight

Can't breathe, can't sleep

I'll kiss goodbye to my reservations
I know theres other fish out in the sea
Not for me
I want you

Then I don't want anyone

If it gets any deeper could be critical
I'm not your love monkey
So be taking back all the lies you sold
What did you want me to be
It's just too much now
So tell me, so tell me, so tell me one two three four

So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spending my time pleasing you
Why must you keep me underground
Tell me, tell me why you wanna bring me down?
Is it too much to give a damn
When I'm giving you one hundred and ten
Don't blink cause I won't be around
Tell me, so tell me, why you wanna bring me down

I took it as a warning

This thing we may have started
Intentional or not I
Don't think we saw it coming
It's all adding up to something

That asks for a commitment

Why's everything gotta be so intense with me
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot and I say why not
If I say forget it I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat this odds

Guess this means you take back all you said before
Like how much you wanted anyone but me
Said you'd never come back but here you are again

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life would suck without you

Maybe I was stupid for telling you goodbye

Put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure you've found it
Slow motion
Sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh, yes they will
They don't want to define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills
Then get cold feet

Oh, no
I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your hand
In my hand
And your heart
On your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

I'll tell them we both just moved on 
When people all stare 
I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk 
Whenever I see you, 
I'll swallow my pride

Pretend I'm okay with it all 
Act like there's nothing wrong

Is this as hard as it gets? 
Is this what it feels like to really cry?

Speaking up to you about my emotions has always been hard
But this just can't wait, tonight I feel a little bit brave
So I won't let one more day pass without you explaining what we are

This is gonna sound kind of silly but I couldn't help but notice
The last time you kissed me you kept both eyes open
Baby can you tell me what does that mean?
If you're looking over your shoulder then you don't need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on

Don't let me stop you from doing what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool, take no chance, get over you
No, no don't let me stop you, if you wanna leave baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No don't let me stop you

Every day, every day, every minute
Here comes the emptiness, just can't be lonely you know
Every day, every day, hey, hey

This second chancin's really getting me down
You give and takin' everything I dreamed about
It's time you let me know, let me know, just let go

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was an in between to escape this desperate scene
Where every law reveals the truth

The world to move underneath me
But for God's sake
Could you try?
I know that you're true to me
You're always there
You say you care
I know that you want to be mine

Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard
To give me what I need?
I want your heart to bleed
That's all I'm asking for
Oh, where is your heart?

I don't understand
Your love is so cold
...

", u"You've got your mother and your brother
Every other undercover telling you what to say
You think I'm stupid but the truth is that it's Cupid
Baby, loving you has made me this way

So before you point your finger
Get your hand off of my trigger, oh yeah
You need to know the situation's getting old
And now the more you talk, the less I can take, oh

I'm looking for attention not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer, why you still standing here?
Hey hey hey hey, just walk away

...

", u"Is this a dream?
If it is
Please don't wake me from this high
I've become comfortably numb
Until you opened up my eyes
To what it's like
When everything's right
I can't believe

You found me
When no one else was lookin'
How did you know just where I would be?
Yeah, you broke through
All of my confusion
The ups and the downs
And you still didn't leave
I guess that you saw what nobody could see
You found me
You found me

So, here we are
That's pretty far
When you think of where we've been
No going back
...

", u"I woke up today
Woke up wide awake
In an empty bed
Staring at an empty room
I have myself to blame
For the state I'm in today
And now dying
Doesn't seem so cruel
And oh, I don't know what to say
And I don't know anyway
Anymore

I hate myself for losing you
I'm seeing it all so clear
I hate myself for losing you
What do you do when you look in the mirror
And staring at you is why he's not here?

You got what you deserved
...
