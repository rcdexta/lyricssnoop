[u"I've been waiting on the sunset
Bills on my mindset
I can get deny theyre getting high
Higher than my income
My income's breadcrumbs
I've been trying to survive

The glow that the sun gives
Right around sunset
Helps me realize
This is just a journey
Drop your worries
You are gonna turn out fine.
Oh, you'll turn out fine.
Fine, oh, you'll turn out fine.

But you gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.
you gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.

I know it's hard, know its hard,
To remember sometimes,
But you gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.
...

", u"You're not the type
Type of girl to remain
With the guy, with the guy too shy
Too afraid to say, he'll give his heart to you forever
I'm not the boy that will fall to his knees
With his hands clenched tight
Begging, begging you please
To stay with him for worse and for better

But I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl for me

I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can live like this forever
It's fine by me

In the past I would try
Try hard to commit to a girl
Wouldn't get too far
And it always somehow seemed to fall apart
...

", u"A charcoal heart that you can't ignore
Cause you've been burned before
You tell me everything that's good will end

You were building castles in the air
But they fell to the ground
There was nothing there
You said you'd never get so close again

And lately, it's yellow lights and you're braking
Say you just want to wait and
See it all unfold
But baby, when you find what you're seeking
Something you can believe in
You just gotta go

So let's not take it slow oh oh oh oh oh
Let's not take it slow oh oh oh oh
I don't wanna take it slow oh oh oh oh oh
...

", u'I\'m on the phone, you turn your back on me
And we\'re all alone, why is this happening?
I, I never thought I would be questioning
The one I, one I love

But here we are wrapped up in silence
Can we sound the alarm?
Most of its fighting
I don\'t know where to start
I keep colliding with
The one I, one I love

Don\'t make it so hard for me to stay

You should know better than that
And before you go on breaking my heart
And I fall even deeper in love
And my lungs screaming out
"Can you hear me?!"
You should know better than that
...

', u'Ah
Ai yeah
Oh no no
I\u2019ve got five books sitting at the coffee shop
I just wrote a lyric that make me stop
Think about the world of what I got
It\u2019s a beautiful beautiful day
I\u2019ve got
Dreams for food and hope for drink
And new chance come in every time I blink
Sunset\u2019s dripping of thoughts I think
It\u2019s a beautiful beautiful day
But lately
People keep saying me crazy
And like me in the zoo to waving oh
My lunatic follows dreams
And maybe
I just care more about safety
"About can\u2019t ignore but trade these"
Feelings and singing in my head baby singing that
You can do this you can do this
You are not a lunatic
Crazy will be change in your mind
ay yeah
Singing you can do this you can do this
...

', u'I wake up and I\'m sober
Don\'t even know you anymore
Punch drunk on a feeling
Lost in believing I was sure
I don\'t care what you have to say
Damn words get in the way, I don\'t wanna know
I know there\'ll come a time
When I look you in the eyes and say, "I told you so"
And I promise you this
You\'re gonna miss me, miss me
As long as you live
You\'re gonna miss me, miss me
Oh
...

', u"Do you want to be my love, my sight, my heart, and my eyes
My world, my pride, my stars in my skies
I'm looking for a queen who's more than gorgeous on a movie screen
I'm looking for the covergirl of dignified beauty magazine

I want dimples, and simple symbols that she's sweet
Wrinkles her nose, expose what I mean
I'm looking for a four-course meal that isn't based in base desire
I'm looking for a lady that knows the soul is more than an appetizer

Just one more thing
Just one more thing

Do we fit in the pocket, can we fix it back in the pocket
When the dreams and the drums start rocking
Can we dance with our knees not knocking
See I, I want a lady I can put stock in
I want a bass and backbeat to lock in
I want to know real love's not forgotten

I want a teacher who's eager to speak her mind
...

", u"My mother told me,
She said Andy,
You'll be a man soon,
So understand me.
Most of this world sees,
Women like candy.
You'll be a man who,
Will be standing for me.

My sisters, my daughters and wives,
Girls, you will learn are not a shining light.
Dedicate some of your life,
Stand for them all.
Sing it now, me
My sisters, my daughters, and wives,
Girls, you will learn are not a shining light.
Dedicate some of your life
You will stand for them all,

Sing it now
Ladies,
You are beautiful, you are beautiful,
You don't even have to try.
Oh ladies,
You are beautiful, you are beautiful,
More than you could realize.

My mother told me,
She said andy,
I know this song may,

", u'(Verse 1)
It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been feeling like a helium balloon
You know I\u2019m always on the rise
Or is this love, love, love, love, love?
Dead winter but it feels like June
With a smile I can\u2019t hide
Or is this love, love, love, love, love?


No defenses I\u2019m too deep for common sense
Well it\u2019s love, love, love, love, love
Oh my I\u2019m so delighted; I don\u2019t try to even fight it
I think you should know that I will never let you go

(chorus)
Oh I won\u2019t, I won\u2019t let you go
...

', u"I was nearly a soul getting ready to go
Having one last talk with my maker
He said you're going to earth for better or worse
We'll see you back here sooner or later

So I said to him, as I spread my wings
Would you do one thing for me

Would you build me a girl from all over the world
I promise I will always adore you
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and smile from California
Brazilian walk, head from New York, pretty Parisian curls
Build me a girl
Build me a girl

Well the days went by
Wondering why, why it was I hadn't found her
I was staring at eyes
