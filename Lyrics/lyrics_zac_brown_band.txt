And just like me he was wasting time
Turning over every stone to see what he could find, okay.

", u"She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make 'em wonder which way to go
Make a man change his mind

She's a lawyer's queen, a trucker's dream
With a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine

Cadillacs and caviar
Well, that ain't how she rolls
Implants and tummy tucks
She sure don't need those

She's a cool drink of water
When the summer's mean
Poured into those Levis jeans
She's country as the day is long

", u'I ride east every other Friday
and if I had it my way
the day would not be wasted on this drive.
and I want so bad to hold you
son, there\u2019s things I haven\u2019t told you
your mom and me couldn\u2019t get along

so I drive, and I think about my life
and wonder why, that I slowly die inside
every time I turn that truck around 
right at the Georgia line
and I count the days 
and the miles back home to you
on that highway 20 ride.

...

', u"A man was bothering me today and I
wanted to tell him to go away
But I stood and listened to him anyway, okay.
He said he didn't want to shoot that man
And it was his thing and I wouldn't understand
And he had done all that he can, okay.

I guess his body was as good as mine
And just like me he was wasting time
Turning over every stone to see what he could find, okay.
He was filling tank and he asked for money
I lied and said I didn't have any
Then my conscious took over and I gave him a hand full of change.

Don't do a thing.
Stay right there.
You'll lie there.
You don't seem to care

", u'She got eyes that cut you like a knife
and lips that taste like sweet red wine
And pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees 

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She\'s everything I want to say to a woman 
but couldn\'t find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don\'t know what to do
Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel 
it comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

You know I\'ve never been the type that would ever want to 
...

', u"There's a place, where the boat leaves from
It takes away all your big problems
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
Take one part sand, and one part sea, one part shade of a nana tree
The drinks they're cold and the reggae is hot
And I know this is the place for me

So get away to where the boat leaves from
It takes away all of your big problems
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from

See the problem is that you're down there
And there's a perfectly good island somewhere
Where a ride that floats and don't grab your coats
You won't need them where we are going

Get away to where the boat leaves from
It takes away all of your big problems

so we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you

and We'll end up hand in hand
Somewhere down on the sand
just Me and you

Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be

Drive until the city lights
Dissolve into a country sky
just Me and you

Lay underneath the
harvest moon
Do all the things
that lovers do
Just me and you

", u"You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes

", u'Virgil Caine is the name and I served on the Danville train
\'Til Stoneman\'s cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of \'65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell
It was a time I remember, oh, so well

The night they drove old Dixie down
All the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin\' they went
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Back with my wife in Tennessee when one day she called to me
"Virgil, quick, come and see there goes Robert E. Lee"
...

', u"I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line

Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty senoritas

", u"Spent the night with a friend of mine and a handle of good whiskey
We picked guitars and talked about how the glory days we missed 'em
And it didn't take too long to find the truth inside that bottle
Cast a-sea so long ago was a message from my father.

You keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You gotta let 'em go

...

", u"Gonna put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine gonna wash my blues away

Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Wrote a note said be back in a minute
...

", u"You know my old car needs washing
And the front yard needs a trim
And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know its him
And the bills ain't gonna pay themselves
No matter anyway
Cause I ain't in no hurry today

There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair
On a quiet shady river bank
Let the world go on without me
Wouldn't have it any other way
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
...

", u"I play the road,
And the highway is our song,
And every city's like the same three chords
Been helping us along when the story's told
And the crowd has come and gone
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home

Every exit is a season,
Every signal is a beacon
And the wind, it carries me
And it eases up my load
Everyday I drag the turns
Every candle still burns
And every lesson I have learned
Brings us closer to the crowd

I play the road,
And the highway is our song,
And every city's like the same three chords
...

", u"Fell to my knees with a knife in my back,
Never thought you'd be the kind to do something like that,
But you did
Cold hearted

You talked so sweet, and your smell it made me weak,
And I fell so fast that I never thought to ask
If you were
Cold hearted

...

", u"There's a note on the table.
Said I ain't coming back.
Till your sorry ass is gone.
I'm tired of the cheating and running around.
I never saw the wrong in anything you've done.

Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.
There's got to be a bottle in the back.
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.
Got to get this devil off my back.

Well I stumble my way into my local bar.
...

", u"I hear the waves
Sun beatin' down on my shoulders
It's a near-perfect day
Wishin' I wouldn't get any older
They say that it's gone 'fore you know it now

Quiet your mind
Soak it all in
It's a game you can't win
Enjoy the ride

I feel the change
Goin' on all around me
...

", u"She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in,
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay,
She's answered by the tail lights
Shining through the window pane

He said I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then
She said you're ramblin'
You ain't ever gonna change
You gotta gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'

At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln,
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin',
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same 'ol light shinin',
...

", u"A man's blood runs hot
As high as the temple will go
Though we can deny our nature, baby
It makes us less in control

There's a beautiful lady who breaks in the sand
With secrets that she only knows
Oh she gives and she takes with each wave that she makes
And it's to her that I must go

Cause she settle me down
Settle me down
Oh won't you settle me down
The coolest fever in my blood
Oh won't you settle me down
C'mon

Oh it's not my style
To be afraid
Of what evil men gon' do
...

", u"We never spoke a word
But every thought she had I heard from across the room
If we were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish prides to blame

Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
and my heart won't tell my mind to tell my mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
...
