[u"Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no

Make the stars look like they\'re not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She\'s so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won\'t believe me
And it\'s so, it\'s so
Sad to think that she don\'t see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say...

When I see your face
There\'s not a thing that I would change
\'Cause you\'re amazing just the way you are

Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute, and now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way

Is that alright? Is that okay?
There's no need to be nervous, no babe
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing babe
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's my first time with you

'Cause at the end of the night
It is her I'll be holding

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me
Baby, baby, please don't go away
But when I play, I never stay

To every girl that I meet here
This is what I say

Run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, getaway, getaway, darling
'Cause everything you heard is true

Your poor little heart will end up alone

Turn the TV on
Throw my hand in my pants
Nobodys gon' tell me I can't

I'll be lying on the couch just chillin in my snuggie
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie
Cus in my castle I'm the freakin man

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Well, I know this little chapel
On the boulevard we can go
No one will know
Oh, come on girl

Who cares if we're trashed
Got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron
And it's on, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no, no

You're all I have
At night when the stars
light up my room
I sit by myself

Talking to the Moon
Try to get to You
In hopes you're on
the other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool
who sits alone
Talking to the moon

So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

You can count on me like one, two, three, I'll be there

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me
Baby, baby, please don't go away
But when I play, I never stay

To every girl that I meet here
This is what I say

Run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, getaway, getaway, darling
'Cause everything you heard is true

Your poor little heart will end up alone

Turn the TV on
Throw my hand in my pants
Nobodys gon' tell me I can't

I'll be lying on the couch just chillin in my snuggie
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie
Cus in my castle I'm the freakin man

We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Well, I know this little chapel
On the boulevard we can go
No one will know
Oh, come on girl

Who cares if we're trashed
Got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron
And it's on, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

Somewhere far away
I want you back

I'm crazy
But they don't understand

You're all I have
At night when the stars
light up my room
I sit by myself

Talking to the Moon
Try to get to You
In hopes you're on
the other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool
who sits alone
Talking to the moon

Standing at this liquor store,
Whisky coming through my pores,
Feeling like I run this whole block.
Lotto tickets and cheap beer That's why you can catch me here,
Tryna scratch my way up to the top.

Because my job got me going nowhere,
So I ain't got a thing to lose.
Take me to a place where I don't care,
This is me and my liquor store blues.

I'll take one shot for my pain, One drag for my sorrow.
Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow.
One shot for my pain, One drag for my sorrow.
Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow.

Me and my guitar tonight, singing to the city lights,

I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see

When we are called to help our friends in need

You can count on me like one, two, three, I'll be there
And I know when I'm needed
I can count on you like four, three, two, and you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do

her curves goes every which way
got skin like porcelien
the way her hair falls down her back
billy accents her tattoo?
(are you talking to me?)
The way her hair falls down her back
billy accents her tattoo?
Her legs like a supermodel
she worn for them high heel shoes

She got every single guy in the club just watching her move
and she dont wanna dance with anyone let her do what she do
she got every single guy in the club just watching her move
and she dont wanna dance with anyone let her do what she do

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"[** feat. Philip Lawrence:]
Her Heart Is Racing*
And The Room Is Heating Up
And Her Eyes Are Glazing
But She Still Can't Get Enough
The Beat Is Bumping Now Shes Blowing Up Blowing Up
The Last Thing On Her Mind is Growing Up Growing Up
She'll Kiss The Sky Before Shes Giving up Giving Up
Ooh Here She Comes
Shes Dancing With The Stars
Living In The Sky With Diamonds

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
Yeah, a different city every night
Oh, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie your wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit

Give away a few Mercedes, like here lady have this
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months since I've single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Hos
