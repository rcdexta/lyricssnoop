[u"[Cher - Chorus]
We ain't ever gonna go grow up, we just wanna get down,
tell the DJ turn it up real loud.
No we'll never grow up and if we had our way,
we would do this everyday.
Lets go!
[Verse]
I gotta flow that'll make you drop, I gotta flow that'll make you pop.
I gotta flow that'll make your mother and your father, call the cops.
We're gonna make this thing go blow, we've got a system overload.
We're gonna be the generation, that makes everything explode.
And when I say explode I don't mean that we using bombs,
We doing stuff that we don't ever have to tell our moms.
Love this life we got, we got it all up in a bomb.
Paper chasin' yeah we buying everything we want!
[Chorus]
Somehow, some way, we're gonna have it our way,
We don't give a what-what you say. NO WE DON'T.
We ain't ever gonna go grow up, we just wanna get down,
Tell the DJ turn it up real loud.
No we'll never grow up and if we had our way,
We would do this everyday.
We ain't ever gonna go grow up, we just wanna get down,
Show everybody who runs this town.

Um, yeah, la-la, la, la, la
Uh

Hey, boy, you never had much game
So I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away-way-way, uh
Now I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns, uh

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this, uh

And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this, uh

Boy, you can say anything you want
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back, uh

I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like shh looking at you flying

I keep building walls up but u tear 'em down
I'm fighting I don't wanna like it but u know I like it
But u know I like it like it like it
Used to always think I was bullet proof
But u got an AK and ur blowing through
Explosive, u don't even know it, I want u to know it
I want u to know it know it know it
All of them other boys can walk away
They ain't even in the game
Cuz they know that u own it
U got this swag u got this attitude
Wanna hear u say my name

Flying with ur love, shining with ur love, riding with ur love
I feel like I'm on top of the world with ur love
One hit with ur love can't quit with ur love so sick but so what
I feel like I'm on top of the world with ur love

You should get some of your own
Count that money, get your game on
Get your game on, get ya, get ya, game on

You can't stop looking me, staring at me
Be what I be, you can't stop looking at me
So get off of my face,
You can't stop clickin 'bout me
Writin' 'bout me, tweeting 'bout me,
I can't stop, it's what I gon' be,
My swagger's in check

Get on the floor, get, get, get on the floor

Get on the floor, get, get, get on the floor

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"It's my last big breath, what you want me to do?
When you act all cool like you already knew
That I'll be stuck here cold just waiting it through
'Til your heart starts beating for that somebody new
You know that it's true
'Cause it's beautiful people like you
Who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you
Who suck the life right out of my heart
And it's beautiful people like you
Who make me cry
'Cause nobody else could be
Nearly as cruel as you
It's a wicked game that you're making me play
(making me play)

With all that's in my power

Til I was sweet and sour

And gave you all my sugar
You knew that I'd be useless

I thought it would be ok
We shared everything

No way

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"I'm the kind, I'm the
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm a, I'm a beast on the track, lay a beat down
Put the vibe on the map, try cut me up, try knock me down
But you ain't gonna take my crown
Let me be the girl to mess up your plans
Try take me, take me off the map
You will never get why I can
From my mouth better than these feet, these feet
Why you gotta see there's a room for me, there's a room for me?
There's a button up to the penthouse suite
I don't need all that
Rather be level headed than a one man
Hold up a second bring it back
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track

Sorta checking you out
Loving what you do boy we oughta paint the town
You gon' watch me get to it double roll and lean
Make up your mind if you're liking what you see
Don't' want no flowers, don't buy me no gifts
I need somebody who can take care of this
I'm loving what you do cause I know you do it well
You got the game tight real smart I can tell
[Chorus:]
Please don't play the usual games
It's time to put out your play

And I-I-I, I didn't wanna end up here
Could you get me that dress
That you throw right 'round

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"On the first page
Of our story,
The futur seemed so bright.

Even angels have
Their wicked schemes
And you take that
To new extremes, but you'll
Always be my hero.
Even though you've lost
your mind.

Just gonna stand there
and watch me burn
well that's alright because
I like the way it hurts
