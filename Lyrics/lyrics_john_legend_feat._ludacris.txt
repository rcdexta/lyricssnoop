[u"Ain't this what you came for
Don't you wish you came, oh
Girl what you're playing for
Come on, let me kiss that
Ooh, I know you miss that
What's wrong, let me fix that

Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had

The best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

Freestlying in the restroom
Til you blowing cigarette smoke
