And you said we wouldn't make it

For so long my heart was breaking

Made me fall harder each day

But that's what I need to let go

Tell me what you've got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite
Tell me what you've got to break down the walls
Kick senseless my defenses

Tell me what you're gonna do
I need you to light the fuse
Tell me what you've got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite

(Got dynamite)
Got dynamite
(Got dynamite)

I dont know why
Im so afraid (so afraid)

And i dont know how

to fix the pain (fix the pain)

We're livin a lie

Cuz we're out of time

and its still the same

You cant stop the world
but theres so much more that we could do
You cant stop this girl
From falling more in love with you

You said nobody has to know
If its time to go
and take it slow

A shame you waste it
When you're breaking me slowly but I've

Got a world of chances, for you
I've got a world of chances, for you
I've got a world of chances
Chances that you're burning through.

I've got a paper and pen
I go to write a goodbye
And that's when I know I've

With that kind of body it needs a spotlight

Ain\u2019t no body know your name
But looking like you do could be fame
I could see us making ways
From the back of the club
To a bed in the shade

Now I don\u2019t know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin\u2019
Who\u2019s that boy?
Wanna take you home
And get you all alone
And everybody here is thinkin\u2019
Who\u2019s that boy?

Oh he got me
No, I\u2019ve never seen, no
No one like them
Them he\u2019s everything
Girls they want him

And today it\u2019s heading in
Did you really mean it
And could you say it again? (Oh, oh)
Even if you just say it over the phone

You wanna make it real

It makes me crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid
But I\u2019ll take a chance, I\u2019ll listen
Hope you don\u2019t destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee
I\u2019m the only girl you see
What you say, boy?

You\u2019re my only shorty
You\u2019re my only shorty
I\u2019m telling you the truth, girl it\u2019s only you
You\u2019re my only, you\u2019re my only
You\u2019re my only one and only

You\u2019re my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'Remember love
Remember you and me
Remember everything we shared
On this planet when we cared
Remember hearts
Remember unity
Remember laughing neighbours without expecting favors
Why be afraid
To make an honest mistake
If you acknowledge the pain
And you wanna change
You can get through anything

Do you remember at all
People walking hand in hand
Can we feel that love again
Can you imagine it all
If we all could get along
Then we all could sing this song together
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Singing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Look at me
Look at you
Now look at me again
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'This line is words you said,
Have all gone to my head
I hear angels sing, in your voice
When you pull me close,
Feelings I\u2019ve never known
They mean everything,
And leave me no choice

Light on my heart,
Light on my feet,
Light in your eyes,
I can\u2019t even speak
Do you even know,
How you make me weak

I\u2019m a lightweight better be careful what you say
With every word I\u2019m blown away
You\u2019re in control of my heart

I\u2019m a lightweight easy to fall easy to break
With every move my whole world shakes
Keep me from falling apart

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Locked up tight
Like I would never feel again
Stuck in some kind of love prision
And threw away the key (Ohh Ohh)

Terrified
Until I stared into your eyes
Made me start to realize
The possiblities (So, So)

I'm gonna love you like I've never been broken
I'm gonna say it like it's never been spoken
Tonight Tonight
I'm letting go,go,go,go
I'm gonna give it like it's never been taken
I'm gonna fall like I don't need saving
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"It's probably what's best for you
I only want the best for you
And if I'm not the best, then you're stuck

I try to savertise and I,
Ended up with wounds to bind
Like you're pouring salt in my cuts
And I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can't bandage the damage,
You never really can fix a heart

Even though I know what's wrong,
How can I be so sure
If you never say what you feel, feel
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up

I\u2019d say hold up, broken out of nowhere, showed up
I\u2019m not
This haste got me skipping a heart beat
I\u2019m giving up

I wanna run, run, run away
In your getaway car, make a getaway

If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If you\u2019re gonna take me down, I surrender
I\u2019ll give you anything you want
Just to leave me alone
This is a hold up, this is a hold up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'Now that I\u2019m thinking sober
Don\u2019t you try to get no closer
I\u2019m just gonna get in my car and drive, and drive
Looking in the rearview mirror
Everything is so much clearer
Watch me wave it all goodbye, goodbye

The light\u2019s flashing, giving me all the danger signs
Someone to save, to save
But it don\u2019t work that way

Think you made your greatest mistake
I\u2019m not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk on such a bad lie
Won\u2019t be taking the midnight calls
Ignoring the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written in your face
You know you made it
Your greatest mistake

When the last straw is broken
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"The day I first met you
You told me you never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was
Now here we are, so close, yet so far
Having not past the tense.
When will you realize
Baby im not like the rest

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared is wrong
I think I might make a mistake
Theres just one night to live
And theres no time to wait (to wait)
So let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break , your heart a break
Theres just so much you can take, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
(I will give you)

On Sunday, you went home alone,
There was tears in your eyes,
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Don't walk away like you always do
This time
Baby you're the only thing
That's been on my mind
Ever since you left
I've been a mess
(You won't answer your phone)
I'll say it once
And I'll leave you alone
But I gotta let you know

I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring
And I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing like we used to
Oh, kiss (or hold) me like you mean it
Like you miss me 'caus I know that you do
I wanna get back get back
With you

Don't look at me that way
I see it in your eyes
Don't worry about me I've been fine
I'm not gonna lie I've been a mess
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I throw all of your stuff away
Then I clear you out of my head
I tear you out of my heart
and ignore all your messages

I tell everyone we are through
Cause I'm so much better without you
But It's just another pretty lie
Cause I break down
Every time you come around
oh, oh

So how do you get here under my skin
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should have known better than trying to let you go
Cause here we go, go, go again

Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're falling together
You'd think that by now I know
Cause here we go, go, go again

You never know what you want
And you never say what you mean
But I start to go insane
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I am confident, but I still have my moments
Baby, that's just me
I'm not a supermodel, I still eat McDonald's
Baby, that's just me

Well some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything, because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well everything's the same in the La La Land of shame

Who said I can't wear my converse with my dress
Well baby, that's just me

That hid my face
So afraid to tell the world
What I've got to say

But I have this dream
Right inside of me

To let you know

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me

Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
This is me

And I think, that we might be onto somethin, no
And I know it's somethin special
Seein you here is not coincidental, mhmm

And I've been fightin, fightin from the other side
I've been sayin, sayin that I won't fall this time
But now I'm walkin, walkin within enemy lines

cause i know that you want
To be moving on

I wish it would snow tonight
You pull me in and avoid a fight
Cause I feel
A separation coming on

Just prove that there is nothing left to try
It's the truth
I rather we just both deny

You kiss me with those open eyes
It says so much
It's no surprise to you
But I've got something left to say

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December
