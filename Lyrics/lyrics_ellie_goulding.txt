Wait for me as long as it takes

And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Push the heaviest doors
That you can't open
Yeah, they tied me up
And my body lies still again

You're as bright as the sun
And as cold as the moon
I don't know when you'll break
But it's gonna be soon
If my will caves in
I'll be in the same boat as you

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I had a way then losing it all on my own
I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

(Home)

Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope they'll still be there
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In another place the only time I feel safe
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You're so quiet
But it doesn't faze me
You're on time
You move so fast
Makes me feel lazy

And let's join forces
We've got our guns and horses
I know you've been burnt
But every fire is a lesson learnt

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open
Heaven knows
You're so worth it, you are

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Oh, oh, starry eyed
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning

Handle bars, and then I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one

Next thing we're touching
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning
Ahhh

Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes
Whoa oh oh ah ah
Whoa oh oh ah ah
Whoa oh oh

So we burst into colors, colors and carousels,

Who are we to play with hearts and throw away it all?
Who are we to turn each others heads?
Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds?

Oh, I don't like the way I never listen to myself
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help
Oh, I don't think you know me much at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Like all the boys before
Like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before
Like all the boys, boys, boys, boys

You left your blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a hand print on the door
Like all the boys before
Like all the boys before
(Boys boys, boys, boys)

This is our luck baby running out
Her clothes were never off
We still have hours to run about
Scale the map, scale the map to get us back on track
I\u2019ve seen you in a fight you lost
I\u2019ve seen you in a fight

We\u2019re under the sheets and you\u2019re killing me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"You wait for a silence
I wait for a word
Lie next to your frame
Girl unobserved
You change your position
And you are changing me
Casting these shadows
Where they shouldn't be

We're interrupted by the heat of the sun
Trying to prevent what's already begun
You're just a body
I can smell your skin
And when I feel it, you're wearing thin

But I've got a plan
Why don't you be the artist; and make me out of clay\xa0?
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I've shown you all the places I'm dreaming of
I'll take you to the ocean, I'll bring the sun
We are 17, we have just begun
I have loved to fight for and then some
you are the one, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one,

Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies
There will be no blood and there will be no pain
I want to fall in love with you again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we still be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling

It starts with a picture
And it sits in your frame
And we part with a letter
And it ends in my name
It starts with forever
And it ends with a touch
And I know that you're clever
And I don't ask for much
Ooh...
Maybe we forgot all the things we are when are together
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You said I'm arresting
You said I had heat
I really tohught that we would go further
The second time we'd meet
Now I'm tired of trying to keep you
All I want to do is sleep
But perhaps when I'm sleeping
You'll get back on your feet
Ooh...

Signs don't show
You drove me off the road

But you let go
'Cause your hope is gone
And every question fades away

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's false start

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
When you know this is your biggest mistake

You tread water

And you fit like a glove

That is no way to love

And the weakness in giving in

Push the heaviest doors
That you can't open
Yeah, they tied me up
And my body lies still again
