[u'Dance, yes
Love, next
Dance, yes
Love, next

Shimmy shimmy yah, shimmer yam
Shimmer yay
I\u2019m a ol\u2019 dirty dog all day
No way, Jos\xe9
Your girl only go one way, ay mi madre
You should check that out
Maybe you ain\u2019t turn her out
Maybe it\u2019s none of my business
But for now work it out
Let\u2019s get this, dale

Nobody knows what I\u2019m feeling inside
I find it so stupid
So why should I hide
That I love to make love to you baby?
(Yeah, make love to me)
So many ways wanna touch you tonight
I\u2019m a big girl got no secrets this time
Yeah, I love to make love to you baby
(Yeah, make love tonight)

If this would be a perfect world
We\u2019d be together then
(Let\u2019s do it, do it, do it)
Only got just one life this I\u2019ve learned
Who cares what they\u2019re gonna say?
(Let\u2019s do it, do it, do it)
