[u'Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home
It\u2019d be a home run
Show me how you\u2019ll do
I want shut down the club
With you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
Oooh

I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping
Music, I might lose it
Blast to the roof, that\u2019s how we do\u2019z it
I don\u2019t care the night, she don\u2019t care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get popping, ain\u2019t no suprise
Take me so high, jumping no doubts
Surf but no drown
Oooh, Said I gotta be the man
When they heading my van, might check one too
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, 
and y\u2019all get lose lose
After bottle, we all get bit and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that\u2019s the motto
Club shuts down, I heard you super model

Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home
It\u2019d be a home run
Show me how you\u2019ll do
I want shut down the club
