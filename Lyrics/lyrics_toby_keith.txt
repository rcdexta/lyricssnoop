And settling\' down, would you marry me?
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?"

Lord, she\'d have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot
His heart wasn\'t in it, he just stole a kiss and he rode away
He never hung his brim up at Kitty\'s place

Shoulda been a cowboy, should\'ve learned to rope and ride
Wearin\' my six-shooter, ridin\' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin\' a young girl\'s heart, yes, like Gene and Roy
Sang a few rodeo songs, yeah, I should\'ve been a cowboy

Might\'ve had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James

Just to clear my head
I saw a flashing neon up ahead

And pushed my way to the bar
Shouted for a drink
Over a screaming guitar
A drunk on a stool

Barkin' like a dog, howlin' at the moon
You'd be mad as an ol' wet hen
Up all night wonderin' where I had been?
I'd fall down and say come help me honey
You laughed out loud, I guess you thought it was funny

I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
You ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'

Yeah I'm paintin' the house and I'm mendin' the fence
Gone out and lost all my good sense

And feel just like it used to be and

You can come to me,

One man stood alone
And somehow he missed
What didn't exist
How could he have known

He looked all around him.
And lifted his head
For he heard a voice
And rose to rejoice as somebody said

This place needs a woman's touch
To share in the plan
For without a woman's touch
Life don't mean much to a man

Up through the ages

I want you to know, I do what I do.

Can you forgive me? I hope that you'll be happy.
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying

I haven't got to yet.

put on my glove and play some catch

wade the shore, cast a line,
look up an old lost friend of mine
sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss

There's a band called The Lonely playin' downtown tonight
And man, they know their way around the blues
There's not an empty space in the parkin' lot
And there's a line stretchin' around the block
And the sad man standin' at the door says the place is full of broken hearts

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Bad love, she took a good shot
Heartaches, she's had a whole lot of tough breaks
No one could blame her if she holds out
She's a little worried to jump right in
She ain't in a hurry to try again
She's takin' time off from love

But every night
She cries just a little bit less
She tries just a little bit more

She's got every right
To wait until her heart has healed
And when she's ready
I'm here and I'm gonna hold her
Inch by inch, she gets a little closer to me
Every night
...

I tipped the bartender, he rang that old bell
San Bernardino nights are great
But they sure don't feel like home

Right now in Tulsa they've turned up the lights
The band has stopped playin', they've called it a night
She's makin' her way to the front door, I know
She won't be leavin' alone
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Right from the first day
One man stood alone
And somehow he missed
What didn't exist
How could he have known

He looked all around him.
And lifted his head
For he heard a voice
And rose to rejoice as somebody said

This place needs a woman's touch
To share in the plan
For without a woman's touch
Life don't mean much to a man

Up through the ages

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"(Toby Keith)

Day by day, we let love just walk away,
And I'll be the first to say,
I was glad to see it go and day by day,
Ever since you went away,
I'm finding I'm still missing you,
And I just got to know.

Does that blue moon,
Ever shine on you,
I wanna hold you close to me,
And feel just like it used to be and
Baby, if you feel like I do,
You can come to me,
Does that blue moon,

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?
There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong. Nah Mean?
How can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga
He never even met that he don't even know and shit?
I think this rap shit is all beef

Y'all don't even know every day I'm livin with stress
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless
I'm on the dance floor hot ass vest
You think I'm freakin' these chicks right?
I'try not to brush against they chest
You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped
Swear to everything when I leave this earth
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine
We'll lose two lives, yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me
And I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars... Lucky Me

[Chorus: Karen Anderson]

The one where we first fell in love
I played the same song that we used to dance to
Hopin\' it might be enough

But when I told her I was sorry
That only made it worse
Then the waitress came over and saw Lisa cryin\'
Said, "Honey, what\'s the matter with her?"

There\'s nothin\' wrong with her, she\'s perfect
She\'s as pure as she can be
She\'d never say it
But the only mistake she ever made was me

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"(Toby Keith/Wayne Perry)

It's not because she's always satisfied
Or that she's so easy to please
She showed me what love's about
That's for sure and I don't mean maybe
Absolutely, there's no doubt, boys
Nothin' too good for my baby

She's gotta have it, she's gonna get it
That's what she wants, that's what I'm gonna do
No matter what it takes, the sky's the limit
She's gotta have it, she's gonna get it

If out of the blue, I stop and give you a call.
Once in a while, it's breakfast in bed.

If I call in sick, just to stay home with you.
I want you to know, I do what I do.
It's my way of saying, what I can't express.
But I want you to know, Girl I'm doing my best.

Ooohh I'm just a man, that's the way I was made.
I'm not too good at saying, what you need me to say.

I know I should have gone home but I was doin' that Caribbean thing
I was listenin' to a Spanish guitar, drinkin' Margarita's under the stars
With a pretty senorita when the telephone started to ring, guess who

Hello, honey, I was just about to
Hello, baby, I was gettin' ready
Hello, I know I should have called sooner
Oh, no, no

Hello, if you give me just a minute
Hello, don't you hang up till I'm finished
Hello, you're the only one I've ever, you know
Hello

It hasn't changed since I been gone
Oh, this used to be my way home

They paved the road thru the neighborhood
I guess the county finally fixed good
It was gettin rough
Someone finally complained eneogh

Fight the tears back with a smile
Stop and look for a little while

The only thing missing is me

From a mile away
She's got her big wheels turnin'
She's got Oklahoma plates

She's got her sun roof up
She's got her windows rolled down
And you oughta feel the ground shakin'
When she comes to town

Yeah I'm in love with the girl in the four-wheel drive
Chrome steel bumpers and red step side
She has a large time in her large machine
Man I wonder how she gets up in that thing

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"(Toby Keith/Wayne Perry)

Word sure gets around in a tattle tale town
That why she never goes out at night
But when her kids go to school and her husband's gone too
She gets in her care and she drives
To a little motel on the outskirts of town
Puts on her perfume and turns the bed down
And I'm the only one who knows Victoria's secret

Her husband's always working and he's never home

This world's a jungle there ain't no justice
Laws of nature rule this land
Better hide your horses, bury your whiskey
Hold your woman any way you can

Cause there ain't no right or wrong, nothing's carved in stone
It ain't cheating if you don't get caught
Jokers laugh and losers grieve
Cause out here there's no honor among thieves

She said, "Goodbye at the cattle guard gate"
Hoping she would find her a place in the world
With her mind made up and tears in her eyes
It almost made her daddy cry
He said, "Don\'t forget to call when you get there girl"

Driving on that two lane road
Hoping she might find
A whole lot more waiting up
Ahead than what she left behind

Moving upstairs, downtown
Life\'s too short to be hanging around
She\'s eighteen and it\'s time she got out of the wood
She\'s getting out while the getting\'s good

You just ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'

I used to come home late and not a minute too soon
Barkin' like a dog, howlin' at the moon
You'd be mad as an ol' wet hen
Up all night wonderin' where I had been?
I'd fall down and say come help me honey
You laughed out loud, I guess you thought it was funny

I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
You ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'

Yeah I'm paintin' the house and I'm mendin' the fence
Gone out and lost all my good sense
An' too much of work is hard for your health
I could've died drinkin', now I'm killing myself
I'm feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash

It's never been out here on my sleeve
Here tonight with you it's quite a different story
You bring out a side of me, no one has ever seen

There's somethin' I'm afraid to say to you too early
But I'd be a fool to wait too late
My mind is cautious but my heart is in a hurry
Which one's right is really hard to say

In other words, I can't put, 'I love you'
In other words when I look into your eyes
No other words can capture what I'm feelin'

And it's comin' true at last
Now lookin' back, the hard times
Were just lessons from the past

I finally climbed the highest mountain
Now I'm standing tall
There were sacrifices made
But now the price is paid to you I owe it all

You're not the woman behind the man
You are the reason I am who I am
You've always been my guiding light
Leading the way through love and life

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Lookin' back on my younger days
Life was a play and the world a stage
Lust, love and greed were in my heart
I thought I had to play each part

I'd skip school and get in a fight
Had a different girl every Friday night
But it all came out in the wash
Dad always said boys will be boys

Mom and dad backed me through it all
Picked me up each time I'd fall
In fact they called it growing pains

Sleepin' in their cars 'cause they didn't have homes
They thought this place was the promised land
If you could roughneck, we could use a good man

Come on, boy, let me show you around
You could make a lot of money here, livin' in a boomtown

Well, some build bars and big hotels
Downshift drive and the people live well
High on the hog and wild on the range
Pocket full of cash instead of chump change

This place kicks when the sun goes down

I bet you never heard ol\' Marshall Dillon say
"Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of runnin\' away?
And settling\' down, would you marry me?
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?"

Lord, she\'d have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot
His heart wasn\'t in it, he just stole a kiss and he rode away
He never hung his brim up at Kitty\'s place

Shoulda been a cowboy, should\'ve learned to rope and ride
Wearin\' my six-shooter, ridin\' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin\' a young girl\'s heart, yes, like Gene and Roy
Sang a few rodeo songs, yeah, I should\'ve been a cowboy

Might\'ve had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James

I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own

I had a reputation
for never staying very long
just like a wild and restless drifter
like a cowboy in a song

I met a darkhaired beauty
where they lay the whiskey down
in southern Arizona
in a little border town
she had to dance for money
in that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
played that girl a tune, yea

Never see it comin'
just hits you by surprise
it's that cold place in your soul
and the fire in her eyes
makes you come together
like wild horses when they run
now the cards are on the table and
the bullets in the gun

we still had shots to kill

Down my shot, shoot my beer
I ain't gotta go home but I can't stay here

It's a short, short walk down to my second home
But that boulevard gets longer when you're walkin' back alone

And I don't know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinkin' I'll come home
One day and find you

Long as I got that neon light

Barely full of whiskey, all laid up in bed

Could've quit my job and let my beard grow out
Another sad old story that you hear about
But I got nothin' from you
Came without a warning at all

It was hot and dry when you told me goodbye
Now isn't that a hell of a deal?
Right out of the blue, you broke it in two
Now you wanna know how I feel

Why don't you come around when the swellin' goes down?

Get out of your clothes
Or get out of my car
