[u"Well it was just a dream
Just a moment ago
I was up so high
Looking down at the sky
Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars
On a Saturday night
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

Cause I'm gliding up there oh so very high
That if the clouds were to drop me
Then I'd fall out the sky
I don't really know why I'm here
I guess I'm just here for the ride
I swear, it feels like I'm dreaming
It's vividly defined, yeah
So call me whatever you want
Tie me to whatever you like
But let's get one thing straight
You know my name, so I run this town
When I'm on this mic, yeah
So here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray
I don't know, need I know
But I know, that I float
Rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes
Then I go, as my story goes
...

", u"Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby

They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby

I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun

With no directions just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
This is how I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly I ended up with none

There's no much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking baby, I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wondering
If there was something that you wanna know

But never mind that, we should let it go
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let them go
Go, go

Well ask me a question I tell you no lies
Cause there's nothing to hide my souls' in my eyes
And I'm ahead of my time but I cannot rewind
The only thing I fear is the mirror in my bathroom
People look and try to see a disguise
But there is nothing that nobody can't see in light
If it's a song with a rhyme or a verse with a line
Then you understand in my mind

But you can't see past my shades
Past my shades

And you can't see past my shades

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel

And I'm Manning up like Payton be, game is over, I should take a knee
And bow out gracefully, even if you look me in my eyes

These American stripes, these American stars,
But these American cages have American bars
We hunger for truth, so we headed for ya'll
Towers are crumbling, bridges are falling
Limits are fading, but normal is boring
Looking at time move, aggressively forward
Looking at days just, just vanish before me

Did not treat her friendly

So when she went home, it was wrong evidently
So lonely and empty

Well, lookin\' for love in a club got her drunk
Met a thug named Bud, got her pregnant with a son
Here he come
In a sub-division there\'s a couple engaged in a fuss
One of them grabs a gun {gun cocks}
In the street, all alone, there\'s a kid
Tryin\' to wipe away the tears after what his momma did

Cause I'm in Beast mode, feast mode
Give me those beats I eat those
All day I don't sleep no
I don't even know what I got sheets for
Them pillow cases and bed frames oh nah take that, don't need those
So high I don't get high, don't even know what I got weed for
People I'm in beast mode, why'd you think I got these teeth for
Why do I rep that east side and why do they all call me B.O
But see I do this beat for
Anybody fed my ego
Back in the hood at east shows
So we take hood wherever we go
Please know, I am as loyal as loyalty is when it's gave
Dedicated, determined, dependable

With a business plan in my head,
And the vision of a politician.

They kicked you on the ground when you most need help
Until you dried up and they sit you on the shelf
And then you start to cry because you all by yourself

And you could still be holding her hand
Like the last note of the saddest song
We\u2019re like the last word at the end of the poem
You know, sometimes wanna be here alone
It\u2019s funny how you never know what you got \u2018til it\u2019s gone

They can take these clothes off my back
They can take my money
Don't care about that (no)
They can\u2019t take my words (take my words)
It\u2019s all I've got
They can have this fame
It ain't worth a lot
Only thing I know, is I'll never let you go
