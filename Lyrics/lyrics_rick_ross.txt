Look up at da stars she like, honey where the roof?
Pull up, hear the dogs, canaries dey go on roof
Even once had a job pourin' tar up on the roof

Dat boy had it hard no facade, it's da truth
So now when I menage and get massaged just to proof
Proofs in dat pudding & dat bakin' sodas takin'
Paper dat would make take dem photos naked

Listenin' to niggas like whistlin' at Wiggie Williams
I flip my middle finga I'm chillin' on 20 million
Da room has turned me on I'm masterbatin' at da top
These hoes so excited so dey catchin' every drop

I'm dodgin' the barcols like pot holes in Jamaica
We cut down the weed, bury the paper on the makers
Martin had a dream, Bob got high
I still do both but somehow I got by

Treflo prayed, Mike Vick payed
Bobby Brown stray, Whitney lost weight
Kimbo Slice on da pad when I write
Dat may why they money lookin' funny in the light

But who really cares if you just throw it in the air
Celebratin' wealth pourin' Moet in her hair
Excuse me her weave the blue is her weed
Trunk full of white, car smell like blue cheese

Dat boy get salad beef bow movement

Gold emblem with two M's in it
This living is so magnificent, stop dreaming it

Oh, I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you

I'm tha magnificent with tha sensational style
Far from bein' shallow 'cause she caught me wit a smile
Try to figure out my style, baby, that will take a minute
But if all we got is time, you can't be actin' timid

So we back to playin' tennis
We been goin' back and forth
She the one that I adore
So I tried it in aurar

Conscience intervened concentrating on my cream
I'm tha king, make a move, pawns all tha way to queens
I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a G
I'm a CEO which means that I profit off of me

All white T's still rockin' my Nike Airs
Fresh outta flight school 'cause I'm fly right here
Ain't nothin free, I'm chargin' to breathe air
If it's not a Maybach really who da hell cares?

My money long, my nigga, my money strong

Wake up in Jamaica.
Couple nautical knots, I call my Cubanos to cop,
Puerto Rico for women,
Hit Barbados to shop.
Living larger than life,
Call this the Yacht Club,
Before you join us, bitch you gotta get your stocks up.
She walking back and forth,
She just itching to fuck,
And then I heard her whisper: (\xe2\u20ac\u0153Girl, you know he rich as fuck.\xe2\u20ac\x9d)

There is no better breeze.
If he indulge in jealousy his ass better breathe.
Man overboard \xe2\u20ac\u02dccause he going overboard,
Damn it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s over for him- Put that on my vocal chord.

spoke on a homocide
amongst other things
even shared my triple beam dreams

us blacks kids born with birth defects, we hyperactive
mentally sex-crazed dysfunctional they describe us
they liars, the end of the day, we fucking survivors

look at that big house, that porsche paid for by crime
how could i sell this poison to peoples in my mind
they dumb to destroy themselves is how i rationalise
in a bastardised nation, magnum 4.5 carrying
where i'm from, aint far from washington heights the cop aryan
a rookie boy the cookie didn't make no profit
a stranger to the block i damn near had to make them cop it
it only took a fiend to taste it once to say it's garbage
i brought it back to poppy, aint tryna take no losses
he focuses on my emotionless young dealer face then pauses
he gives me powder he has faith in nases
ambition's to distribute coke
had additions to gold chains, mercedes benz hopes

This is the life I'm in a race to get money
This is the life I need a bad bitch to blow it for me

Maybox were a dream now it's all real
It's hard to get sleep layin next to five mil
I'm still gettin chips I call 'em the guce bumps
Yeah Alexander vision I'm buildin like two Trumps
Steppin guce bumps I'm the main event
We got a pocket full of game brain it made me ten
Six bitches numbers on the same yacht
? that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
You see it these niggas livin of the past
I ran a hundred miles but I did it all with class
Hands of glass wrist all glass
Mirror on the wall? with a Cristal ass
Champagne pours celebrate the curse
? above the laws with the mercy of the lords

While we do our thang give me six feet nigga

Now she's tight with her moms (what?)
Yeah I put the ice on her arm
Now she know she gettin' sliced
Spending nights in Milan (yeah)
We still blow... together
Cheated on her but we still gon' be together
With the house on the water hit the beach whenever
She's from the north & still can't believe there whether Boss.

Put her on the payroll 'cause flat out she get's down
See that ass from the side that's before she sits down
And her mouth get wet as a bottle of Crystal
Niggas lookin at me, pa but I'm packin a pistol
Fuck kicked out, bitch I'm tearin this shit down

I don't make love baby we make magic
Come home with a thug, let's get's c******
Always wear plastic cause baby s*** happens
She leave the backseat just to freak in da magnum
Hopped out the magnum hopped in the tray
Just to let the top back and thank God for the day
Who gives a f*** what a hater gotta say?
I made a couple million dollars last year dealin weight
Still in da streets strapped with them thangs
She in love with a G so she tatted my name (ROSS)
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
Ten black maybacks back to back in a lane
I'm a make it rain then I'm a make it back
You are just a lame lil homie that's a fact
Workin with the police actin like ya know me
Fresh outta jail already in ya old?

Gotta fresh line up fresh outfit bouta have the parking lot on smash
Plus I got a chevy with a 4-54 in da hood dat bitch got 1-25 in da dash

Every dollar that I count can't grow in my account
My account can't count up all my money in an hour
'Cause it's comin' too fast & I'm scared it won't last
Look that white girl in her face told her this was her last dance
God damn speed got my heart racin'
See I don't have the nominations you can blame it on my occupation
Caesar salad, Caesar's Palace
You not a boss little nigga 'cause your cheese is average
In the Benz AK ridin' shotgun
It's a Benz 'cause your broke 'til you got one
It ain't nothin' do 100 in the maybach
Throwin' money out the roof muthafuckin' brake pads.

I needs a real bitch, 365
Let her count the cheese let her see the pies
Might say I'm foolish but we have a bond
She make moves on my behalf when I had no bond
All the death threats 'cuz I owed niggas
She told me get rest, those are hoe niggas
That's a real bitch she had to show niggas
'Cuz I was blind to the fact she was a hoe, nigga
I'm counting dough, nigga she'll double count
Something come up short she'll point it out

She will catch a flight she will run a route
