[u"Don't tell me love is something you wont try again
That's just not true
But baby right now, maybe what you need is a friend
Well I'm here for you

I will be by your side
If ever you fall deep in the dead of the night
When ever you call
And I won't change my mind
No, I'll see you through

Everybody down in Huston calls him "Texas".
Everybody way up North calls him "Cornbread".
You shoulda heard the way that his momma called him "baby",
daddy called him "boy", his friends call him "crazy".

Shoulda just called it like I saw it.
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day.
The burning, the stinging, the high and the heat and the "left-me-wanting-more"
feeling when he kissed me.
I shoulda just called him "Whiskey".

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Out of all the places in this little town
Yeah you had to come walking in here and sit down
I'm hiding and hoping my face ain't to red
Since we been over been trying like crazy to get you out of my head

So
Why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good don't know what
You were thinkin'
You were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you

I wish you had on sunglasses
To cover up those blue eyes
I wish you said something mean
Made me glad that you said goodbye
Why can't you off somewhere
If you catch me stareing at you
Why can't you be cold like any boy ex would do
