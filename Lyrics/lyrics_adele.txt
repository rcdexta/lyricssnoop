[u"Daydreamer
Sitting on the seat, soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past and feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before

A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks, he is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch, and he could change the world
...

", u"Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me
that's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This isn't a routine with you, it don't mean that much to me
...

", u"I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love

should I give up
oh should 
should I give up
oh should 
should I give up
oh should 
...

", u"You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault

See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

...

", u"Found myself today singing out your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

...

", u"Right under my feet, there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down, turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
And I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
...

", u"So little to say, but so much time
Despite my empty mouth, the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, 
don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, 
...

", u"Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who want to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
...

", u'When the rain is blowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

...

', u'You\'re set in stone and I never give in
I think you\'re stubborn \'cept you\'re always softening
You say I\'m selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you\'re giving off way too much in fact
I say we\'ve only known each other one year
You say, "Pff, I\'ve known you longer my dear"

You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we\'ll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do

You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

Pulls me down, turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
And I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love

", u"So little to say, but so much time
Despite my empty mouth, the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, 
don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, 
...

", u"Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who want to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
...

", u'When the rain is blowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

...

', u'You\'re set in stone and I never give in
I think you\'re stubborn \'cept you\'re always softening
You say I\'m selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you\'re giving off way too much in fact
I say we\'ve only known each other one year
You say, "Pff, I\'ve known you longer my dear"

You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we\'ll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do

Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right

This ain't lust, I know this is love

should I give up
oh should 
should I give up
oh should

Sitting on the seat, soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past and feeling up his girl

He would be hard to chase
But good to catch, and he could change the world

It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me
that's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last

This isn't a routine with you, it don't mean that much to me

That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
To hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it

You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault

The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
