[u"(There's a hole in your bucket)

Suns out, we got a beach day,
Forget yourself, say why don't we people watch?
Kids are playin' 'round in the sand.

(Little boy crying)
Oh no, he's got some troubles,
Got us laughing as he throws his shovel,
Nothings really going as planned.

I don't know how we're going to build a castle now,
Do you want to start again somehow?
I'll stay until the sun comes down, down, down.

(Are you smiling?)
Look over my shoulder,

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You seem too good 
Too good to be true
You're 
Holding me stronger 
Stronger 
Than I'm used to

Don't go out 
With the boys tonight 
I won't sleep a wink 
Wondering 
What you're doing
Don't go out 
With the girls tonight 
I will turn to drink 
Wondering 
Who you're screwing

You seem too good 
Too good to be true
I'm loving you longer 
Longer 
That I'm used to

Don't go out 
With the boys tonight 
I won't sleep a wink 
Wondering 
What you're doing
Don't go out 
With the girls tonight

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Make my house of bricks
And I'll stick here when the world
Comes crashing down around me

Make your arms a willow tree
And you can bend with me
Anywhere I'm going

Sometimes it's hard to see
Anything lovely
All the people around me
Going for the money and the money
And the ego

How can you ask me why
I need to know before I try?
I've got to be sure there's more
Than the money and the money
And the ego

Keep your eyes on me
And I'll look to you so I can see
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Tell me, baby is it yes or no?
You've got a face that just don't show what's going on inside
Tell me, I swear I'll take it on the chin
Don't sugarcoat where I fit in, what's going on?

Inside you there's a room, a room with a door
I finally come knocking and I've been here before
Oh, I've got this love for you but what is it for?
If you can hear me then tell me
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'You undo me
I\'m a happy mess
My dress slips to the floor
And I pose, what an amateur
To be like this! "exposed"

You deny the other side of me
That strips good love away
And you kissed my mirror reflection
When I looked at me today

When you look at me the way you do
My fingers tingle
I can\'t breathe until we\'re skin on skin
When you look at me the way you do
My life moves in perfect motion
You\'re doing all the heavy lifting

Worlds collide
I see a side of you
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'Sunshine
On my shoulders
Makes me happy
Sunshine
In my eyes
Can makes me cry

Sunshine
On the water
Looks so lovely
Sunshine
Almost always
Makes me high

If I had a day
That I
Could give you
I would give you
A day
Sure to make
You smile

Sunshine
On my shoulders
Makes me happy

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Hot pink skies,
Twilight of the day
I think that I've been going about this
The wrong way
Kids on my street 
Got it right man, 
There for hide and seek
My best friend she lives up the road
Haven't talked to her in weeks

Oh time dont blind me
I am so sorry

i'm not going to stop you

lazy love and i will slide me 
through your window

I'll be running out soon
He's gona away again
Gone to collect some more

Your hands pressed hard into me
Hot fo the summer you'd be
Gone away again
He's gone away again

We were poor
Yeah we were dream chasers
A skyscrapers not too tall
He's gunna prove me right 'til I'm wrong

I'm craving all the gold and the riches
I don't want to wash my own dishes
He's gona away again

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Sour Candy, endings...
Coffee stains, where oh I'm so tangled up in my
Big sunglasses and, bed hungry
Second day fair

No we went under
The weight was too much to carry in
I felt the thunder
Mr. Don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew
That I could be so sad
We went under

I've been very cautious

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'I threw a wish in the well,
Don\u2019t ask me, I\u2019ll never tell
I looked to you as it fell,
and now you\u2019re in my way
I trade my soul for a wish,
pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn\u2019t looking for this,
but now you\u2019re in my way
Your stare was holdin\u2019, Ripped jeans, skin was showin\u2019
Hot night, wind was blowin\u2019
Where you think you\u2019re going, baby?

Hey, I just met you,
and this is crazy,
but here\u2019s my number,
so call me, maybe?

It\u2019s hard to look right,

but here\u2019s my number,
so call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you,

And all the other boys,

so call me, maybe?

You took your time with the call,
I took no time with the fall

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
Feather cannons everywhere
I\u2019ve looked at clouds that way

Now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I\u2019ve looked at clouds from both sides now

I\u2019ve looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It\u2019s clouds illusions I recall
I really don\u2019t know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy, dancing way you feel
