We could sit down this may take a while
See this girl she sorta looks just like u

She even smiles just the way u do
(You, you, you)
So in a scent she seems
But I was foooool

All my niggas take a walk with me
You ain\'t gotta holla, you can talk with me
Just try to learn where my thoughts can be
And how I stack figures
Learn why I\'m real, still that nigga
I get money I ain\'t gotta do a crime
Shit I hit dimes
What I need with a nine
Before y\'all judge me, be clear
We got nothing but heat here
Beware we here
What\'s my name, got chicks twisted like
What\'s my game?
Pimp things still the same
I smash it, I don\'t harass it
Ma\' I\'m a baller I score and pass it
Feel me, still be filthy
Making hits is a crime, I plead guilty
And this is what we came to do
Party, Diddy, Usher, game is through
Come on
It\'s right around eleven O\' clock
One of your girls just called
Asked you how you look, are you ready?
You tell her you look hot
Not to worry at all
Niggas will be shook, y\'all doin\' it heavy"
She\'s tellin\' you she might change
But you tell her not to
She know that she looks stunning, it\'ll be fine
The club will be full of game
But none of that has got\'chu
Me, I think you\'re runnin\' \'cause I\'m the one
I don\'t know what you came to do girl
What you came to do tonight

We've been hangin' out everyday this week
How about a nigga fix you somethin' to eat
And just chill We ain't gotta wild out just chill
Parlay little Momma, right here

Sippin' on Chardonnay
Slip on that Vicki Secret lingerie
'Cause I ain't tryin' a throw my money away
If I can see you twork it out for me

Layin' in the cut, kissin' and rubbin' and makin' sweet love
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out
Just me on you from eleven till six in the mornin'
I know you like it when I do you like that
Just twork it out

Now that I got you all soakin' wet
I bet you know what's comin' next

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Oh, no, no, no, no...

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that - this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby...

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Everytime I look up
I see it in your face
You wanna hook up with me
(You know you wanna hook up, stop playin')

Instead of acting like you supposed to
You cop an attitude like you're too good for me
(We know that ain't right)
And you know good and damn well that

If I wanted I could take you from ya man
(Please believe it)
With my eyes closed
I could have you eatin' out the palm of my hand

And all your little girlfriends too
(No, you can't get with me and I want you)
Yes, I can and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby

Ain't nobody trying clown you
But you too damn old to play high school games with me
(You know that man too damn old)
Yes, you do, 'cause even when I'm not around you
I be hearin' from my friends you be askin' 'bout me
(What's up with him? That's what you be sayin')

I don't really care
How long you been together with your man
It's just a matter of time
Before I make you mine

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Yo, I'm sick of this man
I can't even talk no more
'Cuz I hate the fact that I love you so much
And you know what I'm sayin'

You don't even understand what this is doin' to me
Every time try to get away
I just can't let you go, you know what I'm sayin'
I just can't let you go

I never ever wanna hurt ya, I just wanna love ya
I just wanna sex you up
I wanna give you everything you need, thing you want, just lay down
Let me love ya all night long
(It was beautiful when we first started)

I don't want to leave you, I just wanna keep you
When they saw me they saw you
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl that's how I felt
Every time I thought it was right, it went left

We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
(What happened to all the good times)
I tell myself I don't want you no more but
I can't let you go
(You see I can't let you go)

So much love and hurt and hate
(I hate this)
People screamin' it won't work
Time and time I say I'm gonna leave
(See what I'm sayin')
But I can't let you go

Now you wanna be real insensitive and act kinda funny man

Yo after tonight... Don't leave your girl around me
True playa for real ask my nigga Pharrell

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Man I'm a playa girl you don't have to call
Six gees in my socks so I have to ball
Luda, without words I'll let the beat break her
Then hit the liquor store and them switzer sweet makers
Yeah, me and some friendly friend friends
Close as the hairs on my chinney chin chin
I'm a be aight tonight we down south
But I plan to get head straight up like Alfalfa

[Usher]
Situations will arise, in our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations, with the guys, I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I, I, I, I, I... I loved U, you were my girl
U see I, I, I, I, I... Thought the world of U
but your so steady still leavin baby

[Chorus: Usher]
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

To have the world but no one to share it with

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Umm why? Umm why?
Umm why?

Living on the edge out of control
And the world just won't let me slow down
But in my biggest picture, was a photo of you and me
Girl you know I tired, our content provide all the material things
That I thought, would make you happy
I'm confused, can you make me understand?
'Cause I tried to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool, maybe I was part
But never took time to see

Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
 (Ah ah ah ah)
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave?
 (Please don't go away)
Baby help me
Without you my whole world is fallin' apart, and I'm goin' crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone
(Oh girl, I love you)
I need you come back home
(You know I need you)
I don't want to be alone, uhh

Girl I put your love up on the shelf
And I guess I just left her to die
Knowin' that together, 'cause I hurt you too many times
And now you're not around
I wish for every moment of time
That I wasted, we used it to make sweet love
Baby be my guide please take my hand
Would you to know that I've got you?
If you need it, I don't wanna be on the outside lookin' in
I gotta have you girl, can't you see it?

Then they really hate you, yeah

You gotta live for you and no one else
Don't let 'em make you feel
Like you're not being real
Just live how you wanna live
You gotta do for you

Dig that
If you work hard then play hard
Dig that
And do what you wanna do

Dig that
Just pop ya collar
Don't let what people say bother you

Dig that
You perpetrators I got something to say
Dig that
You can eat it or throw it away

Dig that
You're just mad 'cause you're
Following in my trap
But can you dig that?

Hey ladies, hey fellas
You know you're doing good 'cause they jealous
Pop, pop and when they hate 'cause you're a go-getter
Pop, pop, pop ya collar, don't let 'em sweat you, pop

Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Hello everybody
Welcome today to the wonderful world of you
Now check it, you have two options
You can eat it or throw it away

See it's a shame that when you're working on doing well
People hate you, yeah
Buying nothing that's not the best for yourself
Then they really hate you, yeah

You gotta live for you and no one else
Don't let 'em make you feel
Like you're not being real
Just live how you wanna live
You gotta do for you

Dig that
If you work hard then play hard
Dig that
And do what you wanna do

Dig that
Just pop ya collar
Don't let what people say bother you

Dig that
You perpetrators I got something to say
Dig that
You can eat it or throw it away

Dig that
You're just mad 'cause you're
Following in my trap
But can you dig that?

Hey ladies, hey fellas
You know you're doing good 'cause they jealous
Pop, pop and when they hate 'cause you're a go-getter
Pop, pop, pop ya collar, don't let 'em sweat you, pop

Hey ladies, hey fellas

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Everytime I look up
I see it in your face
You wanna hook up with me
(You know you wanna hook up, stop playin')

Instead of acting like you supposed to
You cop an attitude like you're too good for me
(We know that ain't right)
And you know good and damn well that

If I wanted I could take you from ya man
(Please believe it)
With my eyes closed
I could have you eatin' out the palm of my hand

And all your little girlfriends too
(No, you can't get with me and I want you)
Yes, I can and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby

Ain't nobody trying clown you
But you too damn old to play high school games with me
(You know that man too damn old)
Yes, you do, 'cause even when I'm not around you
I be hearin' from my friends you be askin' 'bout me
(What's up with him? That's what you be sayin')

I don't really care
How long you been together with your man
It's just a matter of time
Before I make you mine
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Yo, I'm sick of this man
I can't even talk no more
'Cuz I hate the fact that I love you so much
And you know what I'm sayin'

You don't even understand what this is doin' to me
Every time try to get away
I just can't let you go, you know what I'm sayin'
I just can't let you go

I never ever wanna hurt ya, I just wanna love ya
I just wanna sex you up
I wanna give you everything you need, thing you want, just lay down
Let me love ya all night long
(It was beautiful when we first started)

I don't want to leave you, I just wanna keep you
When they saw me they saw you
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl that's how I felt
Every time I thought it was right, it went left

We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
(What happened to all the good times)
I tell myself I don't want you no more but
I can't let you go
(You see I can't let you go)

So much love and hurt and hate
(I hate this)
People screamin' it won't work
Time and time I say I'm gonna leave
(See what I'm sayin')
But I can't let you go

Now you wanna be real insensitive and act kinda funny man

Just when I thought I said all I could say

These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I dont know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions

Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'bout that chick on part 1 I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Hate the thought of her being with someone else

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it been through

And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us

But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away

Who been doin\' it my way, gettin\' my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life I hid love and left the tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I\'d be the one breaking down
I can\'t figure it out why I\'m so

Caught up
Got me feelin\' it
Caught up
I don\'t know what it is
But it seems she\'s got me twisted
I\'m so
Caught up
Got me feelin\' it
Caught up
I\'m losin\' control
This girl\'s got a hold on me, yeah

My Momma told me
"Be careful who you do, \'cause karma comes back around"
Same ol\' song, na
But I was so sure that it wouldn\'t happen to me
\'Cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"I know what you're used to
We're gonna do something different tonight

Now we're gonna do this thing a lil' different tonight
You gonna come over and pick me up in your ride
You gonna knock, then you gonna wait
Ooh, you gonna take me on a date
You're gonna open my door and I'ma reach over and open yours
Gonna pay for dinner, take me to see a movie
And whisper in my ear how bad you really wanna do me
Girl, now take me home and get up in my pants
Pour me up a shot and force me to the bed

I'm always on the top, tonight I'm on the bottom
'Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
'Cause we trading places

No, put it on me, baby, till I say, ooh, wee
And tell to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
We're trading places

Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'It\u2019s like whatever I do
Just can\u2019t get through to you
I\u2019m never gonna tell you nothing wrong
Listen

Now, now she love me, shorty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can\u2019t be found
I lost my way, she said she\u2019d stay
And lately I been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out
I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that
Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back
I know sorries, just wouldn\u2019t do it
Her heart is obliterated, I\u2019m trying to travel through
But it\u2019s like moving mountains
It\u2019s like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It\u2019s like moving mountains
It\u2019s like moving mountains

Why you just leave me, just leave me be
