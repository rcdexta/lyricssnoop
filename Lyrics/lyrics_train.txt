[u"I need a sign, to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know, that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup

When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head
When you can feel the world shake from the words that are said

And I'm, calling all Angels
And I'm, calling all you Angels

And I won't give up, if you don't give up
I won't give up, if you don't give up
I won't give up, if you don't give up
I won't give up, if you don't give up

", u"Well this is just between us
but between us let's get high
In pictures I have seen her
and to see her is truly fine

She's on fire She's on fire

Flowers in her evening set
I get the feeling she won't forget
And there's times you'd long to be her
but to be her is surely blinding

...

", u"She doesn't own a dress
Her hair is always a mess,
You catch her stealin' she won't confess
She's Beautiful.

Smokes a pack a day, but wait,
That's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing
About that hair,
She thinks I'm beautiful
Meet Virginia

She never comprimises,
Loves babies and surprises,
Wears high heels when
She exercises
Ain't that beautuiful
Meet Virginia

...

", u'Ten pounds too much to the naked eye
I don? t take the bus because she drives
Watermelon lipstick, and way too much
She got buttermilk smile and a thorny touch

Street smart, like a Courtney Love
Can? t get enough Hollywood stories of
Anybody famous that can make her feel
Like they? re all kinda friends in a way

No best friend, well one, but she? s crazy
Grew up to end up a Professor of lazy
The last of six kids that all left town
Seems nobody ever wanted them around

But she? s cool like a soda can sittin? on ice
Always orders sushi, only eats the rice
Talks about J Lo like they? re best of friends
I think she loves me, but it all depends

Hey baby, I don? t wanna be your Superman
...

', u"Well an airplane's faster than a Cadillac
And a whole lot smoother than a camel's back
But I don't care how you get to me
Just get to me

Parasail or first class mail
Get on the back of a Nightingale
Just get to me
I don't care just get to me

Prokeds, mopeds take a limousine instead
They ain't cheap but they're easy to find
Get on the highway point yourself my way
Take a roller coaster that comes in sideways
Just get to me - yeah

Go on hitch a ride on the back
Of a butterfly
There's no better way to fly
To get to me
I look around at what I got
And without you, it ain't a lot
But I got everything, with you, everything

...

", u"Well there ain't much entertainment
In a town this size and all
So I got myself up, dressed for this arraignment
'Cause I don't think I'm ready for the fall

Now I find my thoughts deep in this room all by myself
Thinking the moon might just explode if I don't leave
And the more I wait
It seems the more I hate this town
For what it's doing to me
This is when I need you most of all

Then I stepped upon a landmine
And I saw my future rise
I'm getting to know you
Between the lines

...

", u"To be that good, it must be taxin'
 No such thing as satisfaction
 You're makin' things happen while I'm relaxin'
 Like a Sunday afternoon
 My dad used to tell me I was lazy
 I got dance moves like Patrick Swayze 
 I'm the left over turkey for the world's mayonnaisey
 The star next to the moon 
 
 Now I know I'm just here to amuse you
 And I don't mean to abuse you
 But if I could just use you one time 
 
 Tell me what it's like
 To be the queen of it all
 The Neiman Marcus of the Mall
 And tell me what it's like to be the one and only
 All American Girl 
...

", u"When it rains it pours and opens doors
That flood the floors we thought would always
Keep us safe and dry

And in the midst of sailing ships
We sink our lips into the ones we love
That have to say goodbye

And as I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion
That won't seem to let me go

'Cause when I look to the sky
Something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright

And when I feel like I'm lost
Something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here

And every word I didn't say
Caught up in some busy day
...

", u'INSTRUMENTAL', u"Sleepless nights and endless days
And all I do is promise to change my ways
Leave the lights on, you know
I'll pretend you're on your way

You used to say that there's a time
We all deserve to lose our minds
So I lost my mind, now I'm ready
To find my way, hey, hey

Back home today to stay
The way you wished I would
And I swear to stay
The way you wished I would

Was more than just right

I'm gonna say:

Fried getting suntan
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her

You were my everything

And spent more time in my birthday suit with you

And everybody upstairs, everybody down stairs
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them

Not Jimi Hendrix, Jesus or the dude
Who played the sherriff in Blazing Saddles
You not Chris Farley Mr Rodgers oh I've waited so long
You can finally meet my Mom

To take your mind off everything

Where I've been or what I've won
Stand on your corner a thousand time
Lose what I got, keep what I find
It's about you, it's about you

This ain't about the things you say
Or how you make me feel this way
Stand on your corner a thousand time
Lose what I got, keep what I find
It's about you, it's about you

And when I get this feelin'
It's hard for me to come back down
When I get this feelin'

And I could be
That everything you need
And I know this could be
That free fall back to me

helplessly,
wonder why.
everything gotta change around me.
i'd tell it to your face,
but you lost your face along the way.
and i'd say it on the phone,
if i thought you were alone.
why do things have to change?

but, you don't need my pictures on your wall.
you say you need no one.
and you don't need my secret midnight call.
i guess you need no one.
Is anybody waiting at home for you?
cause, it's time that will tell if it's heaven,

", u"For reasons I don't know I treated you so cold
I wish I had those times again
'Cause something that you said keeps
Ringing in my head
Someday you're gonna wanna come back
And you're gonna wanna treat me fine

Everybody needs a little respect
Everybody needs a little time
Everybody needs a little respect
Everybody needs a little

I watched me push you down in dreams I had of you
And all I remember about those days is
...

", u"Tried to write a letter
To tell you how I feel
All I kept on writing
Was slippin' on the tears from the day
An' I was young and brave

Now all these hotel lobbies
Are filled what's to me?
Lonely midnight drivers
Driftin' out to sea, yea
And all those late night lovers
Don't make things better to me

So let it roll in me

", u"I just opened up my eyes
And let the world come climbing in
It's all better now, things are gonna work somehow
If I just sleep another hour
Tried to reach you at your mom's
Hey baby why you trying to keep away for so long
I stopped feeling good, s
omehow I just knew I would
I guess I'll sleep another hour
Feels like I'm wasting my time
Hanging on this same old line
Got to get you off of my mind
There's nothing left for me to find

And all the more I want
All the more I need
All the while you want something more
...

", u"Since then I never feel helpless
Recess, this mess if you do
And I find that even time well spent
Gets bent if you need it to, we do

By now I've showed you how much
I believe in the here
And now and I wish that you knew

Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
I'll be your whipping boy

...

", u"If I could ride this slide into forever
What would I give to getaway
That pain that stayed, seemed like forever
What would you give to getaway

I know this is how I could be over you
You know this is not another waste of time
All this holding on can't be wrong
Just come back to me and I am not alone

You had your man, your fan but not forever
You should have let him, you should have let him getaway

", u"Well this is just between us
but between us let's get high
In pictures I have seen her
and to see her is truly fine

She's on fire She's on fire

Flowers in her evening set
I get the feeling she won't forget
And there's times you'd long to be her
but to be her is surely blinding

...

", u"Sleepless nights and endless days
And all I do is promise to change my ways
Leave the lights on, you know
I'll pretend you're on your way

You used to say that there's a time
We all deserve to lose our minds
So I lost my mind, now I'm ready
To find my way, hey, hey

Back home today to stay
The way you wished I would
And I swear to stay
The way you wished I would

With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey\xa0

But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And then you missed me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
\xa0
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey

And I was your dream come true
You gave me everything I ever wanted

We got too excited for our own good

No more, hold on we can make it
No more holding each other while the words all break it
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end

for everything she puts you through.
She wakes up everyday and tries to greet you,
I'm hopin' that you'll make it through.

I caught every morning,
tried to reach you,
and waited for your Saturday.
With sunshine, divine, I come running,
I'm a change a' heart away . . .

Get Out (Get Out)
Get Out
Let the Mornin' break in you
Get Out
and I won't (Get Out) run unless I'm running after you.

Thought that he would be a high-class mover.

There's nothing more beautiful to me
Except for you
Making my way on the town
And I'm seeing familiar places, faces
In my pile of coffee grounds

The days are better, the nights are still so lonely
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road

I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again

And nothin', both at the same time

Or I'm out of my mind

Would you believe me if I leave you
'Cause here I go

Am I reaching you now
Dearly departed now that you've started, I'm going to finish it

And somewhere in my mind
I know there's no tomorrow

Then no one will

And all throughout all the years
I've never strayed from you my dear
You suspect I'm somewhere else

How many lies must I hear?
How many times must I feel so blue?
How many times must I lose you?

All I Hear now
Is the sound of my heart
Breaking down, losing ground

How many bridges must I burn?
How many lessons must I learn?
How many times must I ask you to stay?
How many times will you push me out of your way?

Hey, na na na, I'll make it with or without you

Felt when our team was on the winnin' side, so I
Paged through some pictures that you left behind

Hey, na na na, hey, hey, thought about you
Hey, na na na, I'll make it with or without you

I guess I would have known love if it whispered in my ear
All I know right now, is that it's been almost a year
That I traded in forever for a kiss that day
But how about some shelter if I promise not to stay

'Cause everybody got one
What's your expectation?
I know you got some of those too

Are you one to fly with the creatures
That always burn up in the flame?
Or are you one to sing with the creatures
That make up the rules to the game?

I wont get hung up, strung up on the reasons why
If you knew me better
Baby, you would change your mind and leave it all behind
What's your explanation?

Have these words that you gave me

I'm not in it to win it
And there's a thousand ways you can skin it
My feet have been on the floor
Flat like an Idol singer
Remember Winger? I digress
I confess you are the best thing in my life
But I'm afraid when I hear stories about husband and wife
There's no happy endings, no Henry Lee
But you are the greatest thing about me

And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're 2 birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever

And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too

Got to have something to keep us together

On the front lobe of my
Left-side brains

Blow my mind

Single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

Hey soul sister
Ain't that mister mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey soul sister

Tonight

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe

Say you will
Say you will

Till I made some tender corn
Then I met some ladies from Marin
We took the highway to the One
Up the coast to catch some sun
They left me with these blisters on my skin
Don't know what I was on but I think it grows in Oregon
So, I kept on going, going, gone right through
I drove into Seattle rain, fell in love then missed the train
That coulda took me right back home to you

I been high
I been low
I been yes
And I been oh hell no
I been rock 'n roll and disco
Won't you save me San Francisco
Ooo ooo ooo, oh oh

Every day's so caffeinated
I wish they were Golden Gated
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away
