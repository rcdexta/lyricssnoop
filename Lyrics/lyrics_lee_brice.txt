I am insensitive I have a tendency 
to pay more attention to the things that I need.
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust, 
sometimes I dunno why you're staying with me?

I'm hard to love, hard to love, I don't make it easy, 
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, you say that you need me, 
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball crashing into your heart like I do

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Last night, outta the blue
Driftin\' off to the evening news
She said "Honey, what would you do
If you\'d never met me?"

I just laughed, said "I don\'t know
But I could take a couple guesses though"
And then tried to dig real deep
Said, "Darling honestly

I\'d do a lot more offshore fishin\'
I\'d probably eat more drive-thru chicken
Take a few strokes off my golf game
If I\'d have never known your name

I\'d still be driving that old green Nova
I probably never would have heard of yoga
Be a better football fan, but if I was a single man

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"When you can look at her picture and not wanna kiss her no more,
when you don't feel like you've been hit by a train at the sound of her name no more
when you can drive down the road and not be afraid of what's being played on the radio\u2026

That's when you'll know it's over
That's when you've made it
over to the other side, ready for another ride
That's when you'll know it's over

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Johnnys fired up his coleman grill
We'v got 24 tall boys on to chill
Yeah 14 of em's mine
Little Marshall Tucker on the radio
You know we'll just catch a little groove before the show
We aint playin nothin slow

At the parking lot party
Tailgate buds just sippin on suds
Aint never too early
to light one up fill up your cup
Cause there aint no party like the pre party
and after the party is the after party
In the parking lot party
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I know your thinking that you got me all figured out, 
A music man like me ain't ever gonna settle down
And your just waintin for it 
For a day that you'll convience me
Just the thought of weddin bells would make me wanna runaway 
But all i can say is 

Don't believe everything you think 
Baby i might just have i ring in my pocket right 
Now so settle on down girl 
Reel that wild imigination in
Baby come on back to me again 
Yeah that minds a funny thing

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Eighty-nine cents in the ashtray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade
Rollin\' on the floorboard

That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dogtags hangin\' from the rear view
Old Skoal can and cowboy boots
And a "Go Army" shirt folded in the back

This thing burns gas like crazy
But that\'s all right
People got their ways of copin\'
Oh, and I\'ve got mine

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Till all the pain is a cloud of dust
Yes, sometimes, I drive your truck
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Well me and the boys are feelin' alright
raisin' some hell, sippin' on whiskey and 'shine, yeah
Bob Dylan on the juke box, shooting' some pool
telling' some stories and stretching the truth and lies
Yeah, I feel the cell phone start buzzing in my pocket 

Boys, you keep on rocking' but I gotta roll, roll, 
Point this Silverado down the road, road
Yeah, I know the beer's here are cold
But I've got something' warm waiting for me at home
Boys, I gotta go see about a girl

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Well I remember friday nights,
We were full of bull natural light
Rockstars, under the parking lot lights
Killin' time in a little town
Window's tinted up, tailgates down
Running our mouths, riding up and down
Just looking for a fight
We heard all our stories a thousand times
Somebody go on and tell 'em again, ain't nobody gonna mind

Here's the good ole boy, the guitars that made the noise
And all the girls we annoyed, and the ones we kissed goodnight,
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Some's born to take life easy, I was born to live life on a dare
I never worried about the fall, y'all, just how high I got in the air
Flippin' dirt bikes and rollin' daddy's truck, the hit
The highs kept me smiling through the tears,
I'll take years off my life before I'll take life off my years

There are those who take it slow and steady, I aim to keep it between the lines
line up their ducks before they're ready, I'll have no regrets when it comes my time
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"A Saturday downpour carved out rivers in the sand
she said it was her first time to see the sea
helping to clime the jetty rocks was the first time I touched her hand
and the rain and the way it felt never let up all week
by Thursday I knew everything about her
And God, the last day I didn't wanna leave without her

The sidewalks and streets were soaked and the sky was gray
but you should've seen her face, shining like that light house
through all the rain and the way she called my name
I've lived those seven days a thousand times,
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I grew up on the edge of a cornfield
At the end of a long dirt road
Carolina plow boy
Ain't had a free summer since I was ten years old

Mama made us pick our own switches
So we could feel the sting of doin' wrong
That set me straight on the road I'm still on

I am who I am
The product of a good woman loved by a real good man
I've learned what I've learned
By findin' the right way in all of my wrong turns

I love what I love
I ain't afraid to say it 'cause I'm damn sure man enough
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"They called them crazy when they started out
Said seventeen's too young to know what loves about
They've been together fifty-eight years now
That's crazy

He brought home sixty-seven bucks a week
He bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street
Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed
Yea that's crazy

Just ask him how he did it; he'll say pull up a seat
It'll only take a minute, to tell you everything
Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I Love You
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"It's really good to see you
You're looking just as good as I recall
Naw, nothing's really changed here at all

I heard you moved to Pheonix
So whatcha doing back here in this nowhere town?
And are you staying at your Momma's house?

Me, oh, yeah, yeah, I've been doing fine
You should know me well enough to know I'm lying
The lights turn red and the lights turn green
The sun comes up and shines on everything
Every day, every day

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'It can make a a man feel like a kid
Or feel just like a clown
It can make him run for cover
Or stay and stand his ground
It can make a man pick up the bottle
Or help him lay it down
It can stop his whole world from turning
Or turn his whole world around

That\u2019s the power of a woman
It\u2019s the touch of her hand
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'I\xe2? ve been around the ocean since I was a kid
I don\xe2? t get to see it much these days
This mornin\xe2? I walked down to it just to say I did
And Damned if it didn\xe2? t take my breath away
I guess some things are just that way
Like a baby sleeping
A Momma kneeling
A Key-West sunset sky
Yeah the chills I get when you lay your lips on mine
That\xe2? s Beautiful ... beautiful every time

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'She got her daddy\'s tongue and temper
Sometimes her mouth could use a filter
God shook his head the day he built her
Oh, but I bet he smiled

She loves and lives her life, unruly
Tears up that dirt road up in a dualy
Dangerous, absolutely
And in a little while

She\'ll be roundin\' that corner on three wheels
Ain\'t slowin down, yellin, "Come on, jump in"
Always up to somethin, crazy, got nothin\' on her

She ain\'t right
She ain\'t right

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"My baby's sweet talkin' the cable man
While I'm a diggin' around up here
Sweatin' my [unverified] off in the attic
Trying to find the rabbit ears

The screen doors off the hinges
And there's a flat tire on the olds
And this GE fridgerator
Ain't keeping nothin' froze

We're falling apart together
Well, it's another flash light dinner
In the dark, mmm, hmm
When times get hard

We just shake us on a little more salt and pepper
Yeah, the good thing is we might be falling apart
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Jeep tires burn my driveway black,
Got my John deere hat turned back.
Brother says there's gonna be a fight,
Sumter County Friday Night.

One black eye and two teeth later,
Sumter High and the Lakewood gators
Brandy May, Nancy Bean,
Waiting at the Dairy Queen!
Jump in the back, take down the top,
28 minutes to Sparkle Berry Swamp.
Come over here give me a kiss,
Lord don't make it no better than this!

Red dirt roads and big tire toys,
Country girls and redneck boys,
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Did you see me lookin' cool in my white tee shirt
and my cowboy boots
and my baby blues
staring at you from across the room
Did you see me looking at you
yes you did
i saw u lookin'

did ya see me looking at your eyes
looking at your legs
looking at your thighs
looking at yo' back side
did you see me looking at your man
i don't understand what a woman do
with a boy like him
a boy like him

i saw your man standing there
and i gave him a glare
and i swear he looked
pretty scared to me
i saw him swallow his pride
and i looked deep in his eyes and he decided didn't wanna
take this outside
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"We got the horses moving
We got woofers grooving
We got the Waylon wailing
Everybody's head is bobbing

I got the muffler flowing
I got my horn a blowing
I got the rubber burning
Down on all fours

Pull in the club
We hear the band bang
Roll through the door
Everybody hey, hey

Four on the floor, feel the beat in your soul
Moving to the rhythm, pumping till you can't take no more
