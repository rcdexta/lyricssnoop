I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care

Oh, did you want me to change?
Well I'd change for good
And I want you to know that you'll always get your way
And I wanted to say

Don't you shiver
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I awake to find no peace of mind
I said how do you live
As a fugitive?
Down here, where I cannot see so clear
I said what do I know?
Show me the right way to go

And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
And the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no
'Cause they're all spies

They're all spies

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'To my surprise
And my delight
I saw a sunrise
I saw a sunlight

I have nothing
In the dark
And the clouds burst
To show the daylight

Oooh and the sunshine
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
The thought of all the stupid things I'd said

Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
The thought of all the stupid things I'd done
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Bones sinkin' like stones
All that we've fought for
All these places we've grown
All of us are done for

And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do, yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"And when I counted up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulders
I send the other ones away

So if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
Well, I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping that everything's not lost

When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
When everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

'Cos if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost, oh yeah
Well, I'll be counting up my demons, oh
Hoping that everything's not lost

If you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
Well, I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hopin' that everythin's not lost

Singing out
Oh oh oh, yeah
Oh oh yeah
Oh oh yeah
I know that everything's not lost

So come on, yeah
Oh oh yeah
Come on, yeah
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Where do we go, nobody knows
I've gotta say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line
I've gotta say, I wasted all your time, oh honey, honey
Where do I go to fall from grace
God put a smile upon your face, yeah

Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I want it too
Now when you work out where to draw the line
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"

So, then, I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to\'ve done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Look at earth from outer space
Everyone must find a place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real, don't give me fake

Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me love, give us a kiss
And tell me your own politik

Open up your eyes
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you?
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me
Don't you?

But on and on
From the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care

Oh, did you want me to change?

Tides that I tried to swim against
You've put me down upon my knees

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
