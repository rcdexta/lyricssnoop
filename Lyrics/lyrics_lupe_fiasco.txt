[Chorus 1]
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
For the day I die, I\'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
For the day I die, I\'mma touch the sky

Back when they thought pink polo\'s would hurt the Roc,
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.
I felt like Bad Boy\'s street team, I couldn\'t work the Lox (locks).
Now let\'s go.
Take \'em back to the plan...
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.
Any pessimists I ain\'t talked to them,
Plus, I ain\'t have no phone in my apartment.
Let\'s take \'em back to the club.
Least about an hour I would stand on line,
I just wanted to dance.
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.
I just wanted to shine.
Jay\'s favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend.
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.

But shorty didn't quit there was something in the air
Yea, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling
Something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it

How I can't lose, I would put it down but I can't
Due to the glue that I use to fuse everything together

I'll abide by the censorship
Soon as they ride I'll get back on my nigga shit

When your spirit is strained and you limited to change
A different hook, the way the sentences arranged
More demented in your deliverance, more sinister in ya slang
Sounds more belligerent when its sang,
The truth... is limitless in it\'s range
If you, drop a "T" and look at it in reverse,
I could hurt, look at the grimaces of the pain
And its worse when it works, and ya membership is game
But you forgettin\u2019 the proof, diminishes in the flames
Like poof, the media cause images in ya brain
Of the score of the war where militants is slain
The faces of the guilty where innocence is proclaimed
And they filthy, the death airs outta winners
The listeners outta lames...
Of the ballad of the man, that the son of a minister has became so:
[Chorus]
Where forth has my Glory gone? (Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah)
Where forth has my Glory gone?
Glory, Glory...
Where forth has my Glory gone? (Where forth has my Glory gone?)
Where forth has my Glory gone?

Then there it go, yeah, right over there
So I prepared to pour it, little scared
My stare lowered, mamma said have no fear

Plus I'm already outta my chair
Gathered up my airs on my square from here for it
It's nothing, right? So here go it
Whispered in her ear, it was crowded in here
Would she care to blow it? She said yeah

You're my sunshine, you're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me

Daydream
I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day

[Lupe Fiasco]
As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep him happy 'cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive
Room enough for one I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sittin on the shoulders but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children
The news cameras filmin
This walkin project buildin
Now there's hoes sellin hoes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs

He came back
In the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grand father was married in
Yes... he was still fresh to death
bling, 2 ear-rings, a chain laying on his chest
He still had it \'cause they couldn\'t find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat like 2 inches behind it
Smell the Hennesey from when his niggas got reminded
and poured out liquor in his memory, he didn\'t mind it, But...
He couldn\'t sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just filling the casket up
floating down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second Grade hand-writing simply read "I miss ya"
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter\'s picture
Right next to it one of his man\'s stuck a swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soaking
Saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open
and he...

This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You go and you live then you die...

Took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot it

I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day

[Lupe Fiasco]
As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep him happy 'cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive
Room enough for one I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sittin on the shoulders but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children
The news cameras filmin
This walkin project buildin
Now there's hoes sellin hoes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs

Yeah

Cool

Turn it up
uh-huh

He came back
In the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grand father was married in
Yes... he was still fresh to death
bling, 2 ear-rings, a chain laying on his chest
He still had it \'cause they couldn\'t find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat like 2 inches behind it
Smell the Hennesey from when his niggas got reminded
and poured out liquor in his memory, he didn\'t mind it, But...
He couldn\'t sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just filling the casket up
floating down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second Grade hand-writing simply read "I miss ya"
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter\'s picture
Right next to it one of his man\'s stuck a swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soaking
Saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open
and he...

This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You go and you live then you die...

O-oh-oh-ohh
