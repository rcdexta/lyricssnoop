[u"I've got these habits that I cannot
I've got these habits that I can't
Ive got these habits that i cannot break

I found life out on the weekdays
When we would drive to some new city
Call me crazy I was born to make a mess
Would you love me still if I were to confess

That I had a little
Too much fun
Back when I was young

I've got these habits that I cannot break
And as I'm older there is more at stake
Go ahead and call me fake but these are the sins
The sins of my youth
I break habits just to fall in love
But I do it on designer drugs
You can call me dangerous
But these are the sins
The sins of my youth

Been killing me for days and days it seems
But the truth is the thing I fear

Why my love isn't good enough
I just don't understand
Why my love isn't good
Enough
For you
I want you to show me
Love and affection
Love and affection
Easing the
Tension
With love and affection

So take it easy on me, I'm afraid you're never satisfied

No, I won't sleep tonight

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waiting for?

You appear as a child put your heart on a seam,
But you\u2019re acting exactly as you do in my dreams
I said you; you are not what you seam
And you\u2019re finding out that

Falling down can feel strange
No one remembers your name,
You\u2019re loosing the game
That the thing about trust
It\u2019s always the same
Sad story again
You lose all your friends
That the thing about trust
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'Lonely eyes been watching me
I can see what you want me to see
I wanna be close to you
All we need now is the dark
Dancing shadows move on to white walls
I wanna be close to you

Heavy eyes been watching me
Rhythms beats and melodies
They make me get close to you
Other guys will sell you tricks
Tell you lies to get their fix
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'Take me on
What ever went wrong
My tongue on your tongue
Makes me feel better
Our first kiss
A slap on the wrist
My heart is a fist
And you\u2019re left of center

Gimme gimme gimme your attention
Strange ways babe
I only wanna move like you move
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Love is a game that we could play
Even if only for today
I don't wanna lose you
We've been apart for far too long
Now we only have a song
Let the music move you

There was a part of me
That never left a part of you
I wish I could be everything you wanted

But I'm still young
Wide-eyed and hopeless
Yeah I'm still young
I want your devotion to this
Can we kiss like we do in my head
Can we dance like we do on my bed
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Started in the morning
My head was getting hazy
Couldn't keep my feet on the ground
She was makin' love to the
Mirror in the bathroom
Didn't hear me talkin' out loud
Bubblegum, lipstick
Baby's got me nervous
Something's got a hold of my feet
You just wanna go
Where your problems won't follow
Baby that's ok with me

Set fire with just a little spark
That's how it goes when you're
Moving in the dark
Set fire with just a little spark
That's how it goes when you're
Moving in the dark

Got no money still
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I'm sick of living under everybody's shadow
I'm sick of everyone's success, I know that's shallow
I'm sick of hearing people lie to get by, to get by
I'm sick of people that can't look me in the eye all the time

I'm tired of girls
I'm tired of boys
I'm tired of nonsense
I'm TA TA TA TA TA TA tired of the process

I'm sick and tired of always feeling second best
I'm tired of never ever making any progress
To all the cool kids on my block
Where's the original thought, tell me?

Oh yeah you never heard us
Don't ever try to turn us down
We're making all the noise
We're making teenage sounds
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Hey baby, won't you look my way?
I can be your new addiction
Hey baby, what you gotta say?
All you're giving me is fiction
I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time
I found out that everybody talks,
Everybody talks, everybody talks

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I could hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always gotta back track
When everybody talks back

Hey honey, you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash talk make me itchin'
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Nothing you could do
could ever stop my baby
Nothing you could say
could tear us two apart
We've got all the spark
to set this place on fire
We got making love
right down to a fine art

Nothing you could do
could ever stop this feeling
Nothing in the world
could ever shake us up
We've got all the stuff to
break all of the rules, yeah
We've got all the stuff
to mess all of you up

We got a mad, mad love
We got a mad, mad love
We got a really, really, really,
really, really, really, really,
mad love

Nothing you could do
could ever stop this burning
Nothing you could say
could ever stop this fire
Tell me I'm a fool
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I found my love, it was just last week
She really had me turnin on
I fight for hours just to try and speak
to my babe I was the only one
don't you know how it feels
to get days and months and years
trapped inside a waking dream
I bet ya you and I could sit back tonight and try
to make it more than just a fantasy

We are fast youth goin nowhere
burnin this town like we don't care
nothin you say could ever put out our fire

We could pretend, pretend for the weekend
We could pretend, pretend for the weekend
outside, the night's as young as us
tonight it's just the two of us
pretend, pretend for the weekend

I found my love, it was just last week
glasses on
I felt the fire in my feet
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"When you walk my way
I feel a rush come over me
A sharp panic, panic
It's the things you say
That makes a rush come over me
It happens all the time
I never was too good at following rules (na na)
I'm better just pretending I was a fool

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for ya
Keep cool, stay tough
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for ya
Keep cool, stay young
I'm just having my fun
With the lessons in love
If I walk away
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Here we go again, I kinda want to be more than friends
So take it easy on me, I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again, we're sick like animals, we play pretend
You're just a cannibal and I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Here we are again, I feel the chemicals kicking in
It's getting heavy and I want to run and hide
I want to run and hide
I do it every time, you're killing me now
