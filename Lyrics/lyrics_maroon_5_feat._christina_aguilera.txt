[u'You shoot for the stars
If it feels right
And in for my heart
If you feel like
Can take me away, and make it okay
I swear I\u2019ll behave

You wanted control
Sure we waited
I put on a show
Now I make it
You say I\u2019m a kid
My ego is big
I don\u2019t give a sh*t
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue
And I\u2019ll know you
Kiss til you\u2019re drunk
And I\u2019ll show you

You want the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves like jagger

I don\u2019t even try to control you
Look into my eyes and I\u2019ll own you

You with the moves like jagger
I got the moves like jagger
I got the mooooooves like jagger
