my back feeling much better, I suppose
I've reclaimed the use of my imagination
for better or for worse, I've yet to know, but I
always knew you'd be the one to understand me,
I guess that's why it took so long to get things right.
Suddenly I'm lost
On my street
On my block

Oh why, Oh why
Oh why haven't you been there for me?
Can't you see, I'm losing my mind this time?
This time I think it's for real, I can see

All the tree tops turning red
The beggars near bodegas grin at me
I think they want something
I close my eyes, I tell myself to breathe

and be calm.
Be calm.
I know you feel like you are breaking down.
I know that it gets so hard sometimes.

When do you come out to play?
'Cause if the Lord is gonna find me,
He'd better start looking today.

Last week my baby hit the slopes.
I spent the weekend setting traps in the road.
I should have been cutting out my eyelids,
you'll never guess what baby did when she got home.

Na na na na
Now at least the birds are singing to me,
but what they're trying to say,
I don't know.

(you're beautiful)
I think they come from the cold
(for all your big mistakes)
I think they come from the cold
(you stayed the same)
to the city that doesn't snow.

So I drove until we both broke down.

And you can take all your things;
the boxes and rings
and get going.

'Cause I've been waiting for...

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night.
Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes.
Will you break and take all the worlds from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.

So I call you out
Just to feel a little better about myself
And I do, baby I do.

all my biggest mistakes?
Or the way that I made it out?

and all you'll overcome
I wanna be the one to put it in a song.
Take every single tear
for all the world to hear.
I wanna be the one to put it in a song.

Had everything under control
Stayed out all night with my boys
I took advantage of your love

If I gotta spend another day without you
I don't know what I might do
I don't wanna think of living without you

Monica, Keisha, girl I'll let 'em go
'Cuz they don't compare to you
I don't wanna spend another day without you

Now realize you're my destiny

Don't go.

on a Saturday night,
all the green of your eyes says "Go, leave it all behind."

But I don\'t need to be reminded a change is gonna come
I can feel it on the tip of your tongue

And I feel alive
We met up once we\'d settled the sun
Between the heat and the work week
The fear is we could use some sleep
but sleep to the superfluous man means better use for beds
and I\'ll bet I\'m coming home alone tonight

I don\'t need to be reminded that this is how it was
I moved on, I passed a billboard down my block
it asks if I\'ve had enough, and aloud I say "I\'ve had too much"

All the kids are bloom from babies into flowers in our eyes
We've got fifty good years left to spend out in the garden
I don't care to beg your pardon, we should live until we die

We were barely eighteen when we crossed collective hearts
It was cold, but it got warm when you barely crossed my eye
And you turned, put out your hand, and you asked me to dance
I knew nothing of romance, but it was love at second sight

I swear when I grow up I won't just buy you a rose
I will buy the flower shop, and you will never be lonely

And I love somebody.
Yeah I love somebody.

your head in the curtains

We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
Cause I never said we are

Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
to know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone

Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

So now I head back up the steps.
Thinking about where I've been,
I mean it's always never like this.
I wanna feel with the seasons.
I guess it makes sense because my life's become as vapid as
A night out in Los Angeles.
And I just wanna stay in bed.

I hold you like I used to.
You know that I am home.
So darling if you love me
Would you let me know?

Well, go on, go on, go on
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come.
Why am I the one
Always packing all my stuff?

For once, for once, for once
I've got the feeling that I'm right where I belong.

And I feel so all alone
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
How do you cry with inanimate eyes
You're never gonna smile
With the way that you're wired
And I feel so all alone

As soon as the headlights lit up the Westside.

we wished upon parallel lines.
Waiting for a friend to call
and say they're still alive.

To my left there's a window
Where did I go?
My reflection just blends in
And bad ideas, but ideas nonetheless in a song.

I put one foot in front of the other one. (Oh oh oh!)
I don't need a new love or a new life just a better place to die.

On how we find our way
You say, "It\'s all up in the stars"

Well, Some nights I rule the world
With bar lights and pretty girls
But most nights I stay straight
And think about my mom, Oh God
I miss her so much

And there are people on the street
They\'re coming up to me
And they\'re telling me
That they like what I do now
And so I tried my best when I took the fall
And get back right up and get in your arms
If you\'re out here why do I miss you so much?

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Carry on
Well I woke up to the sound of silence
the cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
and I found you with a bottle of wine
your head in the curtains
and heart like the fourth of July

You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
Cause I never said we are

Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
to know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

Carry on, carry on
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"What have we done?
Oh my God
What have we done?
Oh my God

This is really happenin'
You never looked so bored.
Can you feel my fingernails?
They've never been so short

It's hard to lay a golden egg with everyone around
It's hard to stay inside my head when words keep pouring out

Like starlight crashing through the room, we'll lose our feathers
Yes, I know it hurts at first but it gets better

It gets better, it gets better
It gets better, we'll get better

It gets better, it gets better
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I've got enough on my mind,
That when she pulls me by the hand
She hasn't much to hold onto.
She's keeping count on her hands
One, two, three days that I've been sleeping on my side.

I've finished kissing my death
So now I head back up the steps.
Thinking about where I've been,
I mean it's always never like this.
I wanna feel with the seasons.
I guess it makes sense because my life's become as vapid as
A night out in Los Angeles.
And I just wanna stay in bed.

I hold you like I used to.
You know that I am home.
So darling if you love me
Would you let me know?

Well, go on, go on, go on
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come.
Why am I the one
Always packing all my stuff?

For once, for once, for once
I've got the feeling that I'm right where I belong.

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I fell in love with a wind-up souvenir
I bought it downtown as I was on my way to meet you

She sounds like the songs
You used to sing to put me to sleep
But, now that you're gone
She's all that I've left to hold

And I feel so all alone
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
How do you cry with inanimate eyes
You're never gonna smile
With the way that you're wired
And I feel so all alone

I gave her to you (I don't need a toy)
I thought you might appreciate it (I don't like the way that it moves)
The way that she dances

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"And it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest,
but it's all alright.
Yeah, it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest,
but it's all alright.

And I got the call soon as the day hit night.
As soon as the headlights lit up the Westside.
I stopped the car and came outside
Cause I know that tone.
I remember the first time
we wished upon parallel lines.
Waiting for a friend to call
and say they're still alive.
I've given everyone I know
a good reason to go.
I was surprised you stuck around
long enough to figure out

That it's all alright.
I guess it's all alright.
I got nothing left inside of my chest,

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I'm standing in Brooklyn just waiting for something to happen.
I can't help but love thinking that everyone doesn't get it.
To my left there's a window
Where did I go?
My reflection just blends in
And bad ideas, but ideas nonetheless in a song.

I put one foot in front of the other one. (Oh oh oh!)
I don't need a new love or a new life just a better place to die.
I put one foot in front of the other one. (Oh oh oh!)
I don't need a new love or a new life just a better place to die.
I put one foot in front of the other one. (Oh oh oh!)
I don't need a new love or a new life just a better place to die.

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'This growing old is getting old
I often find myself here thinking
About the birds, the boats, and past loves
that flew away or started sinking
And it\'s crazy here without you
I used to think this all was ours
We stay up late debate
On how we find our way
You say, "It\'s all up in the stars"

Well, Some nights I rule the world
With bar lights and pretty girls
But most nights I stay straight
And think about my mom, Oh God
I miss her so much

And there are people on the street
They\'re coming up to me
And they\'re telling me
That they like what I do now
And so I tried my best when I took the fall
And get back right up and get in your arms
If you\'re out here why do I miss you so much?

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"So I call your name, cross my fingers
uncross the others, hesitate.
I don't think straight with nothing to prove.

I don't wanna say I'm leaving
so I'll stay until the weekend.
And you can take all your things;
the boxes and rings
and get going.

'Cause I've been waiting for...

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night.
Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes.
Will you break and take all the worlds from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.

So I call you out
Just to feel a little better about myself
And I do, baby I do.
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I remember like it was yesterday
Had everything under control
Stayed out all night with my boys
I took advantage of your love
Then one day you beat my game
Now suddenly everything has changed
Never thought that you would go, oh no
But now I'm missing you so
If I gotta spend another day without you
I don't know what I might do
I don't wanna think of living without you
'Cuz baby, I'm not finished lovin' you
Monica, Keisha, girl I'll let 'em go
'Cuz they don't compare to you
I don't wanna spend another day without you
'Cuz baby, I'm not finished lovin' you
I didn't know how much you meant to me
When I looked up you were gone
Now realize you're my destiny
