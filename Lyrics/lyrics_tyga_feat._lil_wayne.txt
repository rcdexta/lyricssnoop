[u'I\u2019m on it, I\u2019m on it
I\u2019m on it, I\u2019m on it
If we talkin\u2019 bout money b-tch

snap back, chin up
gold chain n-gga
stripes no tigger, tyga b-itches
honey proof liquor
live no liver
theres hoes in this muthafucka straight, trippin
a n-gga no different
so we hold the heat though
smash on the b-tch brains looking like meatloaf
the hoe know me close she lying, Leo\u2019s
pedigree and swag is so cold, zero
hop in Medino, oops I meant Medina,
lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com
life is a b-tch better know how to treat her
I don\u2019t get in between, my goal be to win
young money heisman rookies of the year
