[u"So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We\u2019re just having fun
We don\u2019t care who sees
So what we go out
That\u2019s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh, Uh huh
So what I keep \u2018em rolled up
Saggin\u2019 my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my n-ggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean dont it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501\u2032s jeans on and 
roll joints bigger than King Kong\u2019s fingers
And smoke them hoes down \u2019till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day 
I\u2019m with you b-tch smokin\u2019 grade A
Yeah, uh you know what?
It\u2019s like I\u2019m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin\u2019, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I\u2019m on the chase
Chevy, it's gettin\u2019 kinda heavy, relevant, sellin\u2019 it
Dippin\u2019 away, time keep slippin\u2019 away
Zip in the safe, flippin\u2019 for pay
Tippin\u2019 like I\u2019m drippin\u2019 in paint
