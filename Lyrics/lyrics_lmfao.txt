Shots automatic, better get you a vest quick

They all compete and they all get bested
Why try to test it, just digest it
Spit so clean that\'s why I dress so fresh, kid

You see that girl over there she big chested
Let\'s start my motor boat, face nested
When I do that, she screams all festive
When you do that, she screams, "I\'m molested!"
Now you are arrested

To go down town and to see what I\'m left with

Dancing on the table, life of the party,

Yea this little hottie, she's trying to get me sprung, 
while she's sucking on cherries tying knots with her tongue.

Ooh girl, it's you girl, 
I love it when you're teasing me.
Ooh girl, the things you do girl,

Every little thing reminds me of you

Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you 
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you 
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you...

Yes, party people, we drop and feet go, some make your fist-pump, 
hands up and feet go crazy, 
look at all these ladies, tonight is going down
We party rockin in this place for sure, 
every place that we walk in is the place to go
Popping bottles up for free, with the models every week
Sexy go-gos the way you booty bubbles to the beat is like...
Owning, popping, ain't no stopping, the bass is knockin
Them shots are dropping, some of us came to celebrate
But most of us came to get away

It doesn't matter what I say, don't matter what I do
Every little thing reminds me of you
It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
...

Shake it, spray it on a body or two
And walk out the party with a hottie or two

I'm gonna get you wet
I'm gonna make you sweat
...

", u"Sipping on this drink, have some time to think
About where I was, and where I'm at today
I'm getting everything I ask for
Flying the world, filling up my passport
I'm in the zone, martini's strong, 
my tall is short, but my money long
I'm getting everything I ask for, 
in the club, always keep my glass full

Money in the bank, my car brand new
I got everything I want, but you
I might get you one day, I might get you one day
House on a hill, hollywood view, got everything I want but you
...

", u'Party rock! (Ya, ya)
Take it to the hole, yeah, yeah, yeah like that
Redfoo, reddoo would you like that, yeah
Turn it up, turn it up!
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

I take it to the hole, it\'s Redfoo I\'m aggressive
Four moves ahead, wrong dude to play chess with
I roll with the best click flow so impressive
Shots automatic, better get you a vest quick
(He\'s heating up! ) Could have guessed it
They all compete and they all get bested
Why try to test it, just digest it
Spit so clean that\'s why I dress so fresh, kid

You see that girl over there she big chested
Let\'s start my motor boat, face nested
When I do that, she screams all festive
When you do that, she screams, "I\'m molested!"
Now you are arrested
While we\'re in the club being most requested
Step up now to be the next contestant
To go down town and to see what I\'m left with

Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
...

', u"She never been on a flight,
She never been in a limousine
And now she's living the life
Popping bottles in Italy
She's dancing up on the table
Got everybody's attention in here
She put my hands on her body
And then she whispered in my ear

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for...

I hope this ain't a dream
This better not be no dream
Please don't let this be a simulation
It better be real
'Cause you're a pretty thing
You a motherfucking sexy thing
I hope it's not my imagination
It better be real

I'm dancing on the floor (yeah on the floor)
I'm dancing with you, girl (ooh)
We spinning round and round
You spin me round and round
I'm falling for you girl
I'm falling in love
...

", u"I read your text saying what you wanna do to me 
(all night long)
I think I might be able fulfill your fantasy.
We can ride away, no time to waste, tonight baby 
(all night long)
We can ride away, no time to waste, tonight baby.

Walking up dirty street, she was God over the beast, 
Ooh the way she looked at me
She's out of space like Anakin, 
body like a mannequin, sipping on a girly drink.
Dancing on the table, life of the party, 
got my tongue on her navel, taking shots of her body
Yea this little hottie, she's trying to get me sprung, 
while she's sucking on cherries tying knots with her tongue.

Ooh girl, it's you girl, 
I love it when you're teasing me.
Ooh girl, the things you do girl, 
I love it when you're pleasing me.

You wanna get it shawty (all night long)
Then keep acting naughty (all night long)
...

", u"
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
Oh I cant stop dreaming cause,
Its crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
(Check it check it out)
Oh I can't stop dreaming cause

Yo, it was only dreams, 
I used to play chess at the coffee bean.
And as my coffee steamed 
I thought about my life and my world dreams.
It's so sick and I'm startin' to mix 
thanks to a rest in piece banana split
Was the place we all went Sundays, 
to make people feel this way we would one day
And I remember when you gave me a secret, 
popped in the DVD and peeped it
And if you dreamin you achivin, 
after that it was a wrap
And now I walk in the club like a million times,
Spit on the mic like a million rhymes,
We party rock to a billion drops 
and this shot makes one zillion shots

Yes I'm feelin' good, and we the best I'm feelin' good
And in your breast I'm feelin' good, haha LMFAO
Ima bro with this party thang
