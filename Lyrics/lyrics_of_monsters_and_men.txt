[u'Jumping up and down the floor,
My head is an animal.
And once there was an animal,
It had a son that mowed the lawn.
The son was an ok guy,
Thay had a pet dragonfly.
The dragonfly it ran away
But it came back with a story to say.

...

', u"Taking over this town, they should worry,
But these problems aside I think I taught you well.
That we won't run, and we won't run, and we won't run.

And in the winter night sky ships are sailing,
Looking down on these bright blue city lights.
And they won't wait, and they won't wait, and they won't wait.
We're here to stay, we're here to stay, we're here to stay.

Howling ghosts they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart.
A lionheart.

His crown lid up the way as we moved slowly
Pass the wondering eyes of the ones that were left behind.
Though far away, though far away, though far away
We're still the same, we're still the same, we're still the same.
...

", u"Fishing for a friend,
Can't remember when it was dark
Or the sun coming up.
Far across the ocean lone,
While numb bears at home
...

", u"The sea said goodbye to the shore so the sun wouldn't notice
The sea it wrapped its arms around you

The calm on my cheek feels like the fall grass 
and I run through the tall trees with your hands chasing me

So make all your last demands for I will forsake you 
and I'll meet your eyes for the very first time, for the very last


...

", u"Hey! Hey! Hey!
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes

Some days I can't even trust myself
It's killing me to see you this way

'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry
Our bodies safe to shore

Hey! Hey! Hey!
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will all be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young,
And full of life and full of love

Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear

'Cause though the truth may vary
...

", u'We came here on his back
And we caught your eye.
The salty ocean wind
Made the seagulls cry.
The rocking of his house
Had me holding on
But I knew that I was safe
...

', u"Slow, slow me down,
her blood, on my bones.
Let go, lay to rest.

We fall, we fall, we fall,
we fall to the ground.

Sleep, sleep all night
while the young, they wait alone.
She'll get up, shake the rust.
We crawl, we crawl, we crawl,
we crawl on the ground.

Alone, I fight these animals.
Alone, until I get home.

A wolf, wolf and I, 
we share the same cold meal.
I float on, float on down .
...

", u"Well, maybe I'm a crook for stealing your heart away
And maybe I'm a crook for not caring for it
Yeah, maybe I'm a bad, bad, bad... bad person
Well, baby I know

And these fingertips
Will never run through your skin
Those bright blue eyes
Can't only meet mine across the room
Filled with people that are less important than you

'Cause you love, love, love
When you know I can't love you
...

", u"In the spring we made a boat
Out of feathers, out of bones.
We set fire to our homes,
Walking barefoot in the snow.
Distant rhythm of the drum
As we drifted towards the storm.
Baby lion lost his teeth,
Now they're swimming in the sea.

Troubled spirits on my chest
Where they laid to rest.
...

", u'
Oh, I miss the comfort of this house.
Where we are, where we are.
Where we are, where we are,
The floor under our feet whispers out,
Come on in, come on in, where it all begin

Can you chase this fire away
Can you chase this fire away

We climbed up to the top in worn out shoes,
but she ran down, she ran down.

So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I had caused with my two hands

Alone we traveled on
with nothing but a shadow
We fled, far away

Hold your horses now

Through the woods we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)
Hold your horses now

Through the woods we ran

All the trees outside are buried in the snow
I spent my night dancing with my own shadow
And it holds me
And it never lets me go

But I feel like a waterfall
Yeah, I move slow and steady
Past the ones that I used to know
