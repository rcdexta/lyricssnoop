And im waiting for my rocket to come
Im just a curbside prophet
With my hand in my pocket
And im waiting for my rocket
Ysee it started way back in nyc
When i stole my first rhyme from the m.i.c.
At a west end avenue at 63
The beginning of a leap year, february, 96
With a guitar picked up in the mix
I committed to the licks like a nickel back of tricks
Well look at me now

And the bright light turns to night
Oh until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love
Oh the love that I love

See I'm all about them words
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words than I had ever heard

And my arms unfold

To leave this easy life
Pass me the spoon
Pass the analytical knife

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"[ ] = spoken by Jason

Our friends on the front porch and they telling the jokes and they
Swinging oh-so-swiftly towards happier times
Expending lines and finding more energy for the effort
And getting distance from that front porch spotlight

But us, we found peace in the shadows
Long enough to see the monsters rise
And Candy's got some space to fill in her daydreams
Living high on yesterday's lies
And talking to me about some zero percent interest
And how she got a better deal than the next guy, oh my God
And the way the lightning shocked us, oh, when we were lost
Around that long deserted highway
Well, our hair was longer then, and now I can remember
Say, now well I remember oh-so-well
Almost too well, now

Oh, the roads unencumbered by cats
They're burning like wet matches through my miracle mile mind
But it's all in my mind
You left your thumbprint inside me now for months it seems
But mine only brushes your soft surface
And somehow, somehow it leaves me listless
My tongue curls under my lips, oh, oh yes

So I can speak to tell you of the months before I met you, love
Oh, true love
And the way the truth it locked us
Right about the time after the lightning it shocked us
When we were young, when we were young and missing
'Round that small New England byway
Our lives they were sheltered then and I can remember
And I remember well, so well
It's almost too well

Well, it's not even being about that anymore
I gotta get you down
Those tiny fragments of perfection
They please me in a time unchanged
But it's all the same beginning
And it's a long awaited end
...

of a most unusual girl
She's the paint in my picture
of a most unusual world

She can crawl out a frame
while she's hanging on the wall
And she's calling my name
she's not so usual

She's most unusual
Shes not so usual
She's so unusual

She's mostly a ghost
the way she watches over me
She complains when I smoke
but then you do the same to me

She's controlling my brain activity
knowing when I go to sleep
She'll catch me when I'm falling hard
she's so unusual

She's not usual
She's not usual
She's so unusual

used to talk together, go to the park together
in all kinds of weather we would share
this common pleasure with most of human kinds
it was a kind of treasure one that i was surely glad to find
but i got one right here and i'm okay
i'm okay, and you're okay, and we're okay
i'm alright. everything else is alright sometimes.

Just remember those bones they get broken
and love is not a token of affection
it's not even a real thing, it's a word
so don't you try to but it out with a ring
cause it's a verb, to love someone

When I stole my first rhyme from the m.I.c.
At a west end avenue at 63
The beginning of a leap year, february, '96
With a guitar picked up in the mix
I committed to the licks like a nickel bag of tricks
Well look at me now
Well Look at you now
And look at us now, now, now, now

I'm just a curbside prophet
With my hand in my pocket
And I'm waiting for my rocket to come
I'm just a curbside prophet
Got my hand in my pocket

Got my hand in my pocket
And I'm waiting for my rocket to come on
I'm just a curbside prophet
Got my hand in my pocket

In the box of the regular
Messing with the flavor
Oh, the flavor that you savor

Saving me for last
But you better not eat me at all
Living in a fast food bag
Making friends with the ketchup and salt

People say that I'm crazy
For not moving on to better things
Instead I'm sitting around trash
Talking with the onion rings

But it's much too soon
To leave this easy life
Pass me the spoon
Pass the analytical knife

'Cause you're about to get cut and get cut down
It's all about the wordplay
All about the sound in the tone of my voice
You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold

Better shut up or get shot down
It's all about the know how all just a matter of taste

I'm sorry for wasting your time.

Who am I to say this situation isn't great?
When it's my job to make the most of it
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me.

Pale and fine, I can't dismiss
And I won't resist and if I die, well, at least I tried

And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain
And pore over everything we say we trust
Well, it happened again, I listened in through hallways and thin doors
Where the rivers unwind, rust and the rain endure
The rust and the rain so thin, well, I'm in like Flynn again, I'm in

So go on place your order now
'Cause some other time is right around the clock
You can stand in line, well, it finally begins, oh just around the block

You can have your pick if your stomach is sick
Whether you eat or not

And a man can find a lover

Well she can be as crazy and as foolish as she wants to be
Because her old school ways are practical. Technicalities are perfectly sane.
I'm saying I ain't never seen a saint.

I met her at an old cop bar down in silverlake,
Where we joked about the give and we joked about the take.
And when they asked for identification
I knew her's probably was a fake.

She's just another older lover undercover.
She's just another old-school lover undercover.

She's wearing that thin disguise, don't apologize.

Very cool, very cool. I grew up in Virginia. 
This is the closest Ive ever played to home, so 
This is very very groovy. Lets see what happens.

Strange because I believe it is my future
Staring back at me
With eyes so light 
I never dreamed it could be
Anything else than what they could see
Oh, they are colors 
That collide and scope 
My heart belongs into
Magnificent ever-changing patterns do
Im wide awake at the wheel
Its oh so crazy because I can see
It could be my presence
So pleasantly deprived
Ive never seen the explained prophecies
Or anything else it should be
Oh they are troubled 
And disguised behind wise eyes and wise crackin smiles
Hypnotized behind a panel 
On a thirty hour drive
Im not at all what I seem
