[u'Well I was born an original sinner, 
I was borne from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill for all the things I\'ve done
There\'d be a mountain of money piled up to my chin

My mother told me good, my mother told me strong
She said, "Be true to yourself and you can\'t go wrong
But there\'s just one thing that you must understand"
You can fool with your brother 
but don\'t mess with a missionary man"
Don\'t mess with a missionary man, 
don\'t mess with a missionary man, 
don\'t mess with a missionary man

Oh the missionary man, he\'s got god on his side
He\'s got the saints and apostles backin\' up from behind
Black eyed looks from those bible books, 
...

', u"I never thought that you would be the one to hold my heart
But you came around and you knocked me off the ground from the start

You put your arms around me
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go
You put your arms around me and I'm home

How many times will you let me change my mind and turn around
I can't decide if I'll let you save my life or if I'll drown

I hope that you see right through my walls
I hope that you catch me, 'cause I'm already falling
I'll never let a love get so close
...

", u"All my life you know I haven't been very love strong
there's been so many fights that I fought and I never won
So I decided that I should just give up in trying to right your wrong
And word on the street is she did to you what you did to me.

5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!
Your Goin' Down, down, down, Boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang! she shot you.
Karma Tastes so sweet.

So Unfortunately for girls like me there are more like you
bending and breaking the rules we make exceptions to.
But How does it feel!
To swim in your own tears!
...

", u"Sun is filling up the room
And I can hear you dreaming
Do you feel the way I do?
Right now?

I wish we would just give up
'Cause the best part is falling
Calling anything but love

And I will make sure
To keep my distance
Say I love you
When you're not listening
And how long
Can we keep this up, up, up?

Please don't stand so close to me
...

", u"I know I can't take one more step towards you
Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love
I loved the most

And I learned to live, half alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are?
Runnin' round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms
...

", u"Wait a minute, I don't want you to know.
Its the only way that I might go.
A secret safe behind a pretty smile,
and its mine mine mine mine mine mine

What's with all the late-night liqueur phone calls?
I don't think your lover likes me at all.
A secret safe behind a pretty smile,
But its mine mine mine mine mine mine

What, What might you do?
...

", u'INSTRUMENTAL', u'Can you find the time
to let your lover love you
He only wants to show you
The things he wants to learn too
The hardest parts you\u2019ll get through
And in the end you\u2019ll have your best friend

Love like this may come once
Baby it\u2019s fate
Like a soul mate he\u2019s your penguin
Baby it\u2019s fate
Baby it\u2019s fate
Not luck

Can you find the time to let your lover hold you
He needs somebody to hold to
...

', u"I'm scared today
More than I told you I was yesterday
Give me a moment to catch my breath
And hold me every second left

Proud of me
That's the only way I want you to be
Look at me and love
What you see

I won't make it alone
I need something to hold

Kiss me on my shoulder
Tell me it's not over
I promised to always come
Home to you

Remind me that I'm older
To be brave smart, sweet and bolder
And don't give up
On what we're trying to do

Don't count the miles
Count the 'I love you's'

...

", u"2am, where do I begin
Crying off my face again
The silent sound of loneliness
Wants to follow me to bed

I'm the ghost of a girl
That I want to be most
I'm the shell of a girl
That I used to know well

Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Then you go and let the lonely in
