Wrestling with what he'd done and what's he might
Do while she cries
She's had enough, she's waking up and she decides

She'd rather try to brave it on her own
This hollow house has never been a home

Tired of living a life like that
Giving a love she don't get back
Lies as big as a Pontiac
Rolling all over her

Tired of the words that just won't stick
She knows not to believe it
No more hanging on to what will never be
No more hanging on to what will never be

Turning the pages of yesterday
In only the blink of an eye

That is strong enough
To walk through anything

Wanna fall in deep

Are what I wanna hear

After all this time, you're still in my heart
Yeah, you're still in my heart

You, it's always been you

You and the way you move me
Every time's like the first time, baby, you're

Still the place I want to go

The ins and outs and the highs and lows
Well I gave my heart and I paid the cost
For the loves I made there were friends I lost

At the point I'd almost had enough
Like the morning sun you woke me up
You held me close and you help me see
Oh you made a believer out of me

Now I'm alright, I've got you in my life
And I never felt love, ever feel so right
...

", u'One in a million, Mama
That\'s good enough for me
And you can\'t make me stay here anyway
Now that I\'m 18

With everything she had in a duffel bag
She set out to show the world
She was more then just a homecoming queen
And daddy\'s little girl

In a cloud of dust on a Greyhound bus
She crossed the Cook County line
Slept all the way to Nashville
Big dreams running through her mind

She said, "Sure as I\'m breathing
I\'m gonna be a big star someday"
\'Cause she was jumping right into the deep end
On a leap of sweet blind faith

It\'s about hoping, it\'s about dreaming
It\'s about never not believing
It\'s about taking a walk out on the wire
And never looking down

It\'s about living instead of dying
It\'s about spreading your wings and flying
