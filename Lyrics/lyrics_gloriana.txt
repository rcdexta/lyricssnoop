[u"Down a back road
Long hot summer
A couple kids running loose and wild
He kissed her
She said mister
Take an inch and I'll give you a mile
I ain't here
to do anything halfway
Dont give a damn
What anyone might say
I just want to freefall
for a while
That rebel moon is shining
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasing down
That crazy spark
I'll follow you where you're leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me running baby
Wild at Heart
About Midnight
He Tells Her

", u'I dropped you off
Just a little after midnight
Sat in my car
Till you turned off your porch light
I should have kissed you
I should have pushed you up against the wall
I should have kissed you
Just like I wasn\u2019t scared at all

I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

And I kissed you
Goodnight
...

', u"Well, I've been watching you, girl
The way you move got the room on fire
Oh, yeah, rock my world
Wanna take you home with me

Well, I ain't letting you go
Home with the boy who don't deserve you
Oh, yeah, baby, don't say no
I wanna take you home with me

You should never be lonely
You're the best that I've ever seen

I wanna take you back to my place
You can do your dance on the kitchen floor
I wanna hear your boots knocking down that hallway
Right on through that bedroom door

I wanna lay you down next to me
I wanna ease your mind and maybe set you free
Can't you see? I wanna take you home with me
