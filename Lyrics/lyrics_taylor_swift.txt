[u"There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah

We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I dance
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It\'s the morning of your very first day
And you say hi to your friends you ain\'t seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody\'s way

It\'s your freshman year and you\'re gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven\'t seen you around before"

\'Cause when you\'re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You\'re gonna believe them
And when you\'re fifteen feeling like there\'s nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you\'re gonna be fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you\'re best friends
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ballgowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Hey stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
As we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks
At your window
I'll be the one waiting there
Even when it's cold
Hey stephen
Boy you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

(CHORUS)
'Cause I can't help it
If you look like an angel
Can't help that I if I want to
Kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling Since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
I can't help myself

Hey stephen
I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you
(Ha)I seen it all so I thought
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Say you're sorry
That face of an angel comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you

Holding on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should have known
I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You, you belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe

And you might think I'm bulletproof but I'm not

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down

And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around

And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me, why?

You could write a book on how

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down

And it's taking me this long

And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore

And you can say that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no, no, no

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ballgowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Hey stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
As we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks
At your window
I'll be the one waiting there
Even when it's cold
Hey stephen
Boy you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

(CHORUS)
'Cause I can't help it
If you look like an angel
Can't help that I if I want to
Kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling Since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
I can't help myself

Hey stephen
I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you
(Ha)I seen it all so I thought
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Say you're sorry
That face of an angel comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you

Holding on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should have known
I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You, you belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe

And you might think I'm bulletproof but I'm not

I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down

And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around

And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me, why?

You could write a book on how

And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore

And you can say that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no, no, no

And kissin' in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursin' your name
You're so in love that you act insane

I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

We should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me

Baby, I'm never gonna leave you

In the middle of the night

It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven

Oh, oh

It's half full
And I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying
That you'd be here anyway

I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone and he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low, you can't feel nothin' at all

Oh, oh

Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

Talk to the man with the reasons why,
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open,
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'

I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more out there
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face

I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you

I walked away.
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay.
I said "This time I had enough."
And you\'ve called a hundred times
But I\'m not pickin\' up.
\'cause I\'m so mad, I might tell you that it\'s over.
But if you look a little closer

I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
Screaming: "I\'m in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin\' rain,
Come back for more!
And don\'t you leave,
\'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door.

Me and my stupid pride
Sittin\' here alone.
Going through the photographs,
Staring at the phone.

Said you\'d beat me up you were bigger than me

All summer long
And then the time we woke up to find
That summer\'d gone

I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans

I hope you think of me

You\u2019re gay and by the way

I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You\u2019re a redneck, heartbreak
Who\u2019s really bad at lying

So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I\u2019m concerned
You\u2019re just another picture to burn

There\u2019s no time for tears
I\u2019m just sitting here planning my revenge

Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, Can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay

And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

How's life, tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December all the time

Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said speak now
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play

Counting my footsteps, praying the floor wont fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine

You paint a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why

Dear John,
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can

Calling me out when I\u2019m wounded.
You, pickin\u2019 on the weaker man.

Well you can take me down,
With just one single blow.
But you don\u2019t know, what you don\u2019t know,

Someday, I\u2019ll be living in a big old city,
And all you\u2019re ever gonna be is mean.
Someday, I\u2019ll be big enough so you can\u2019t hit me,
And all you\u2019re ever gonna be is mean.
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides,
And your walk by lies and your humiliation

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say they're the lucky ones

I used to know my spot was next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me

I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter

How'd we end up this way?
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light

To you everything's funny
You've got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

I wont let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom is dropping you off
At 14 there is just so much you cant do
And you cant wait to move out someday and call your own shots

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'There I was again tonight, forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old, tired place lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?" across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts, counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don\'t you let it go
I\'m wonder-struck, blushing all the way home
I\'ll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did !



The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all; I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him along, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor did I suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, Whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, Whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, Ha


She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The water's rough
But this love is ours
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, Can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking about everything we've been through
Maybe I've been back going too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Tall, dark and Superman
He puts his papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mothers eyes and his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yeah

And you'll smile and say how are you
I'll say just fine
I always forget to tell you I love you
I'll love you forever

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
To save the world, I'll be around
And I watched Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December all the time

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said speak now
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break

It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I cant trust anything now
And I'm screaming over you 
Like it's all a big mistake

Woah losing my breath
WOah losing you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, Come on 
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted

Come on, Come on 
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever you're gone
Cant turn back, now I'm haunted

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor wont fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine

You paint a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why

Dear John,
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can
