[u"County road 233, under my feet
Nothin' on this white rock but little ole me
I've got two miles till, he makes bail
And if I'm right we're headed straight for hell


Chorus:

I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slap my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm going to show him what a little girls made of
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Well the road was hot and flat as a ruler
Good hundred miles between me and Missoula
That vinyl top wasn't gettin' no cooler
I stopped at a Quickie Sack
Well I figured I'd need about a six of Miller
And one of those things so I wouldn't spill 'er
And I asked the girl if the beer was in the back
She said

It's a dry town
No beer, no liquor for miles around
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
To wash me down
Outta this dry town

So I turn right around, no hesitation
Cursed the laws for ruinin' the nation
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"They say life is so much sweeter
through the telephoto lens of fame

just as much attention
cheerin' at the high school football game

I dreamed of going to Nashville
Put my money down
and placed my bet
But I just got the first buck of the season
I made the front page
of the Turnertown Gazette

Every last one, route one,
rural hearts got a story to tell
Every grandma, in law, ex girlfriend
Maybe knows us just a little too well
Whether you're late for church
or you're stuck in jail
Hey words gonna get around

I saw her mustang
And my eyes filled up with rage
I brought my pistol but I ain't some kinda fool
So I walked right in barehanded
She was on his arm while he was playing pool
Just like I used to do
She kissed him while I got a beer
She didn't think I'd show up here
I'm a crazy ex girlfriend

I watched her for awhile but I didn't like her walk
She came across kinda cheap to me

Forgivers, no takers
An angel who never got wings
You find Jesus and it's too late

You promise the truth and you told lies
You've really made me believe
That love was supposed to be free

I'll take it if I have to
Go real fast like there's somewhere we can get to

What's the use in hanging on tight to the phone if nobody might call

Desperation
There's danger in frustration
Complicated words slipping off of your tongue and ain't one of them the truth
I'm still desperate for you
Tell it like a lie, live it like a movie
Give a heart away like it don't mean nothing to me

And some how you made me smile when I was sad

Love and pleasure in my life
Daytime boys and nighttime boys
Usually don't see eye to eye
But I've been on a roll of late

Showed up with a master key
And revved it up for me

At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Cause it ain't my problem now

It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car,
I'm packin' it in, so come and get it.

By the time that you turned 33
Are you still a bullet in your daddy's gun
Don't forget boy you're your mama's only son
She's at home and she's been praying for you
So what about Georgia

Lets make it up baby cuz I aint gonna fight
If you're the death of me darlin, I wanna die

You always say that you love me
There is no one above me
Never givin always takin
Never bendin always breakin
I know you ain't a liar, but you don't tell the truth
And you're walking on wire wearing someone else's shoes

Someone's livin someone's dyin
Somebody always looses and we still play the game
And the fire will always burn you and we still light the flame

Lets make it up baby cuz I aint gonna fight
If you're the death of me darlin, I wanna die

You always say that you love me
There is no one above me
Never givin always takin
Never bendin always breakin
I know you ain't a liar, but you don't tell the truth
And you're walking on wire wearing someone else's shoes

If you're handin out misery, I'll be the first in line
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Maybe you're just jaded
From some nobody's unforgotten words
Maybe you're just faded
A little gray from every time that you've been hurt

So you're lookin' for your skin
That you never did fit in
You can't hide when you're turned inside out
Love is looking for you now

Maybe you been burnin'
But you can't blow out a flame that you can't find
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'The sun just got through going down
On a sleepy little Texas town
Population plus one minus one

A new grandma rocks my sister\'s kid
Just like twenty years ago she did
The same thing in that same chair
She said, "This one\'s born to run"

Every day at noon like a chapel bell
Find her Jesus keep her well
Help her do more right than wrong
At the end of the day

I got 5 good years and a tank of gas
Fifty watts and Johnny Cash
A guitar and a broken heart
Just full of things to say

You taught me how to stand those tests and trials
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Highway 65 sure sounds kinda nice
I feel like drivin' somewhere far away
Got the top rolled down, radio up loud
Playin Willie and Old Hank

Well I don't really have a certain destination
I'll just fill the gas tank up and use my imagination

(Chorus)
I wanna feel my freedom blowin' through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind and scream out I don't care
I'm tired of bein' down and out cause that ain't what life should be about
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"well they say there's lots of fans
for those texas country bands
playing all them songs about texas pride
well you can make one little bet
I ain't seen my fan club yet
but I'm hell bent for gettin them on my side

I sing the eyes of texas 
make my home on the range
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I love you, more than you'll ever know.
And I miss you, more than I care to show.
I'll get better at pretending nothing's wrong.
It's easy, when you're always all alone.

Lately, I see leavin in your eyes.
So nothing you say, will come as a suprise.
You don't even have to try to be sincere.
Just go on, and leave me lyin' here.

And I'll tell my heart,
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Well you walked into my heart like it was some old dance hall floor
I should have known better I had seen your kind before
you rolled in like a tumble weed the texas wind had blown
and i feel another heartache coming on

Theres no doubt about it darlin you're the hurtin kind
like all those other memories branded on my mind
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"what in the world is happening to me
I've already tried to shake your memory
I don't know why it is I can't get over you
cus' honey you ain't worth this pain I'm going through

you told me that your love would heal my broken heart
so I let you in my world and you tore it all apart
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Daddy always said he was wrong for me
And in the end he'd only bring me misery
I tried and tried to turn away
But something \u2018bout him makes me stay
The only man who\u2019s ever knocked me to my knees
The only man who\u2019s ever set my spirit free

He was born and raised in Lynchburg, Tennessee
His daddy owns a big distillery
He's an old time whiskey drinker
When I'm with him I get meaner
And momma says he\u2019s ruined my destiny
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I'm texas as hell
made in honery
I don't need no loud mouth
comin' on to me

my temper gets hotter in red white and blue blazes
you know dog-gone well everybody can tell I'm texas as hell

well I know I haven't been around a long time
but I've heard my share of
those worn out love lines
if you ain't redneck 
dont waste your time
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Well there's somethin that i like about a honky tonk
Whiskey drinkin cowboys and lonesome country songs
Wonderin if i'll fall in love or if i won't
Well there's somethin that i like about a honky tonk

Guess that all my life i've been a runnin' round
Playin all the honky tonks from town to town
I'm just not the kind to ever settle down
And a honky tonk's the only love i've ever found
There's somethin' that i like about a honky tonk
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Used to stay for hours, and listen to the rain
You'd hold me on the porch swing
While our troubles washed away
And Daddy'd come and get me
Girl it's time to come inside.
And I'd say, just a few more minutes 
Daddy please, we need a little time
To say our last good-bye
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Alone in a booth, in the pioneer cafe
I'm strung out from the road, a pillow in my hands
I sip the last straw from a cold cup of coffee
And try to sort out my feelings as good as i can
Two hours behind me theres a boy back in dallas
My phone will be ringing his afternoon call
But he'll get no answer, the queens left her palace
Shes alone in a cafe in witchita falls

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Hey white liar
the truth comes out a little at a time
and it spreads just like a fire
slips off of your tongue like turpentine
and i don\xb4t know why
white liar

you better be careful what you do
i wouldn\xb4t wanna be in your shoes
if they ever found you out
you better be careful what you say
it never really added up any way
I got friends in this town

Hey white liar
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Well I've been saved by the grace of southern charm 
I got a mouth like a sailor and yours is more like a hallmark card 
If you wanna pick a fight well I'm gonna have to say good night 
I don't have to be hateful, I can just say bless your heart 

And even though I don't belong with your high life friends 
Doesn't mean we don't get together and try to make amens 
It's easier can you see lets agree to just disagree 
We don't have to like each other but its sure fun to pretend 

So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines 
You got your friend just like I got mine 
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'I feel like the
flowers in this vase,
He just brought em\'
home one day,
"Ain\'t they beautiful"
he said.
They\'ve been here in
the kitchen and the
water\'s turnin\' grey.
They\'re sittin\' in
the vase but now
they\'re dead.
Dead flowers.

I feel like this
long string of lights.
They lit up our whole
house on christmas day.
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Gives you something you 
Can do with your hands
Makes you look cool and 
Feel like a man
In the morning you'll 
Probably regret me

Me and your cigarettes

Started young, 
It's too late to quit
Most call it a 
Bad, bad habit
Your momma told you you 
Could end up dead with me
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I put a bullet in my radio
Something just hit me funny, I don't know
Just pull the trigger going down the road

You slam the door and knock me off the wire
Been walking lines and you've been burning tires
Slowing and easy ain't that what you like?

It's insane
It's in vain
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Sometimes I wish I lived in Airstream
Homemade curtains lit just like a gypsy
Break her heart and roll out of town
'Cause gypsies never get tied down

Sometimes I wish I lived on a mountain
Drank from a stream instead of a fountain
I'd stay there, top of the world
But I was born a red dirt girl
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"If I ever left this town
I'd never settle down
I'd just be wanderin' around
If I ever left this town

If I wasn't by your side
I'd never be satisfied
Nothin' would feel just right
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'My neighbor\u2019s car got stole last night 
Right out of his driveway
We heard the dog \u2018a barking, 
We never paid them any mind
And Mary says she\u2019s gonna lock the door 
From now on when we go away
I\u2019ve been walking around this farm 
Wondering if it\u2019s time

Chorus
Time to get a gun, 
That\u2019s what I been thinkin\u2019
I could afford one if I did 
just a little less drinkin\u2019
Time to put something between 
Me and the sun
When the talking is over 
It\u2019s time to get a gun

Last week a government man was there 
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'Devil had a daughter
Took him to deep water
Tried to kill him with a kiss
He said \u201cHey now honey
What about the money\u201d
I said \u201cI ain\u2019t got time for this\u201d

[Chorus]
Take me, take me somewhere trouble don\u2019t go
Make me, make me someone trouble don\u2019t know

He said baby come inside
I said sorry I\u2019ve got to ride
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"I know they say you can't go home again
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine

Up those stairs in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself

If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I have been draggin' around your sensitive ego
Making sure that your bags arrive on time for the dog and pony show
A little suitcase like a brick,
It kinda makes it hard to get a good grip
I drop your troubles off at the conveyor belt,
I'll hand you a ticket to go get it yourself

At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles on my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car,
I'm packin' it in, so come and get it.
