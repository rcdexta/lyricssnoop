(Tony Martin/Mark Nesler)

If I never think about her, I'll never miss her at all
Never wonder what she's doin, never give her a call
Never see her again and I'll be free as a bird
But the trouble with never is never, never works

If I never bring her flowers, I'll never see her smile
If I never try to kiss her, she'll never drive me wild
And I'll never feel the need to say those three little words
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Back seat of her daddy's car
I was trying not to go too far.
Kept thinkin' 'bout the words the preacher man said.
Lightning flashed across the sky,
I saw love in a young girl's eyes,
And that's a look you never forget.

Seventeen,
Only comes once in a lifetime.
Don't it just fly by wild and free
Goin' anyway the wind blew, baby!
Seventeen,
Livin' on crazy dreams,
Rock-n-roll, and faded blue jeans,
And standin' on the edge of everything.

(deryl dodd/blake a. chancey)

Once upon a lonely time
She swore she'd never let you down
You held her tight without a care in mind
While she did her runnin' 'round
At first you wouldn't face the truth
You loved her too much to let go
And though the story had to end
You wanna be her fool again
Friend there's something you should know

She'll have you back
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'She left Oklahoma for California
Sunglasses on the brim of her hat
Smoke was pourin\' from that old Cadillac
But she wasn\'t turnin\' back

Just outside of Flagstaff
Motor blew on her Coup De Ville
Just in time she saw a sign there\'s was a Texaco
Waitin\' at the bottom of the hill

And she said
"Somebody must be prayin\' for me
Somebody out there must be prayin\' for me
Must be angels I can\'t see
Somebody must be prayin\' for me, yeah"

(Aimee Mayo/Bill Luther)

I never had no one
I could count on
I've been let down so many times
I was tired of hurtin'
So tired of searchin'
'Til you walked into my life
It was a feelin'
I'd never known
And for the first time
I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Everytime I look at you
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"She left more than just her lipstick
When She walked out.
Her memory keeps haunting me
That's why I'm hunting you down.
Its been a long time since our lips met,
You've always been good at helping me forget.
I'll regret it in the morning,
But that's not stopping me now.

Senorita, Margarita,
I'm as lonesome as a man can be.
I still love her, I still need her,
I'm just hoping you can comfort me.
I don't want to do her wrong,
I don't need somebody new,
I just can't be alone tonight.
So Senorita, Margarita,
Let me hold you tight.

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"After all this time
I still miss you everyday
This same world spins 'round
I guess some things never change

Sometimes I go out
But it never feels the same
I still look for you
Baby, some things never change

When I said I'd love you for eternity

(greg barnhill/kim carnes)

She walks over to him and she says do you remember me
I think we might have met somewhere before
Southern carolina is the place that comes to mind
But hey I guess you never really can be sure

Oh there's nothing like a true love
To go and make a fool of someone just like before
And right there for a minute
I forgot that you don't love me anymore

Then an old familiar feeling
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair

When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there

Oh, a sailor's sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget

I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks

She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"When all our tears have reached the sea
Part of you will live in me
Way down deep inside my heart
The days keep coming without fail
A new wind is gonna find yourself
That's where your journey starts

Chours:
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I just want to get a little more out of my payday
Finally own a car that doesn't break down on the freeway
A little vacation
Ain't asking very much
I hate comin' home to this old broken down apartment
I wish I had a dime for every hole that's in the carpet
I don't want it all
But I ain't got enough

All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Every where I go,
they're starin' at her,
every man I know.
He wants to have her
I guess I outta be a jealous man.

I look the other way
they're hittin' on her every night and day
they telephone her
they try and get to her
but I know they can't

(chorus)
Cuz she never lets it go
to her heart
she never lets it go
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Her hat is hanging by the door
The one she bought in Mexico
It blocked the wind, it stopped the rain
She'd never leave that one
So, she can't be really gone

The shoes she bought on Christmas Eve
She laughed and said they called her name
It's like they're waiting in the hall
For her to slip them on
So, she can't be really gone

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"(Verse 1)

I got an empty feeling when that moving van pulled up
It got a whole lot emptier as I watched them fill that truck,
And when they carried out your clothes it took my breath away,
Now they're headed for that bed, and all that keeps running through my head,

(Chorus)

Baby, Maybe we should just sleep on it tonight,
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds,
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Fogged in in Dallas
On my way to LA
Staring up at the screen
All flights were delayed
When a voice from behind me asked
Stranger, how have you been?

Well, I was caught off guard
When I saw her face
Stumbled my way through an awkward embrace
Then somehow I managed to say
Good to see you again

We caught up on old friends
Caught up on old times
But all through the small talk
It kept burning though my mind

Does she think about the nights we spent on Crystal Lake?
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Baby, I go too fast too far
Let's get it straight now
The way things are
I'm not the white knight in your fantasy
But I could be your wildest dream

I might ride with the wind
I might follow the sun
I gotta go where I've never been
'Cause my heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade
I'm a renegade
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'I spent 48 dollars last night at the county fair
I throwed out my shoulder, but I won her that teddy bear
She\'s got me sayin\' "Sugar Pie", "Honey", "Darlin\'", and "Dear"
I ain\'t seen the Braves play a game all year
I\'m gonna get fired if I don\'t get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I\'m getting in too deep

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can\'t rise above it
I don\'t know what it is \'bout that little gal\'s lovin\'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

My mamma and daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in \'till that girl got a hold of me

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"She was reading a book that she'd already read
Just to pass the time
He just sat there and stared at the TV set
Like he was barely alive

When the local news was over
They would climb the stairs
And crawl in bed underneath the covers
Like neither one was there

And it's a long, long way
Across the great divide
The songs that they once sang
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Your eyes say that you've been hurt before
And you can't take the heartache anymore
You think I'll do what he's done to you
Break your trust and be untrue
But baby, this is me you're talking to

You got the wrong man, it's not me
A case of mistaken identity
I didn't break your heart, you see
What can I do to make you understand?
You got the wrong man

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Mister can you take me into Little Rock
I'll buy the coffee and I'll fill your truck
I'll listen all night if you wanna talk

And we can talk about your family
Politics, music, and philosophy
Any old subject's allright with me
Just don't mention Memphis

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Let's just cut it down the middle
Let it bleed and bleed out

I'll take it like a circus lion
Silent in my cage

One part right, and two parts wrong
One part love, two parts pain
One part sunshine, two parts rain

My friends told me you were slippin' away
I smiled and said I don't believe what you say
As long as they'll always be birds in the sky
Your love, your love for me, baby, will never ever die

Oh darlin'...

Your love for me, crumbled in doubt,
One part truth and two parts lie

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'No one wants to think about getting older,
They try to push you out before it\u2019s over;
The same world that lifts you up can put you in your place.

What they call progress will never wait for me
And I should probably just go out quietly,
But I\u2019ve still got something left, something left to say

I will not fall down, I will not fall down,
I will not fall down without getting up\u2026

You kept your face in the gutter for years
Kept your eyes on the road
You always felt you were meant for me
Baby now you know

Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away
Everybody wants to see you
And everybody wants to be you too
It's funny how they put you down
But now they think you're alright
And everybody loves you now that
You're the one that got away

I can send a bridge up in smoke
And I can't count the people I've let down, the hearts I've broke
You ain't gotta dig too deep
If you wanna find some dirt on me
I'm learning who you've been
Ain't who you've got to be
It's gonna be an uphill climb
Aww honey I won't lie

I still got a still few more dances with the devil
I\u2019m cleanin up my act, little by little
I\u2019m getting there

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I dusted off my Bible today
Read the words and read yeah, every word He said
He talked about forgiveness and a better way
I raised my hands above my head and I said

Touchdown Jesus
Touchdown Jesus

There was a little girl just down the street
They were prayin' for a miracle but runnin' outta hope
Some stranger was an angel and he gave her what she needed
You oughta see her today, that was ten years ago

Touchdown Jesus

That's just another story wrote away
All He needs is just a little bit of your faith

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Said her name was a hand me down name
From the side of a family that long ago came
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess.
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips.

She tipped the DJ to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was a rockin' on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said lets go and get it on
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it
I don't know what it meant but it felt good on my lips.

Oh oh oh I. I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I. I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you

Ain't what I'm lookin' for
The music's slow and the beer is warm
You came in the room
Put that record on
Started groovin' to that funky song

And I said, hey now,
It don't seem that late now
I thought the party was windin' down
Hey now look what I just found
Gonna stay now
Bring the Tanqueray, I'll
See how this plays out
Until you looked at me
I was just about to leave
I was just about to leave

Watch dancin' there,
Lit the whole place up,
Made me wonder where you came from, yeah
Some kinda paradise,

Another supper from a sack

And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say

One of these days you're gonna love me

D-D-Domino's delivery
Whiskey sours, apple pies
Finger lickin' chicken fried
Are gastronomic history

I used to like them scary shows
But I gave 'em up a while ago
Don't do no death defyin'
Roller coaster ridin'
Now a days I just take it slow

Ever since we started datin'
I been compensatin'
To keep from gettin' up
To hell any quicker

'Cause she's hard on the ticker
Hard on the ticker
That girl is such a hazard
That she oughta have a sticker
Sayin' hard on the ticker

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"We were born in this little town, growin' up
I was countin' down every single day
'Til we made our get-away

But you said you could never see yourself
Tryin' to make a life anywhere else
This would be your home and I was on my own

But ever since you said good-bye
I've been out here on the wind
And baby you would be surprised
All the places you have been

I've seen you in Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard
Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sun set in
Girl, I swear just the other day

You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from being made of gold
I don't know how but I scraped up the money

Just like when you were leaving Amarillo
Takin' that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile

Darlin' don't you change a thing

If only you could see you through my eyes
You just get better all the time

The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four

A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin\' round the table
Don\'t happen much anymore

We\'ve gotten too complicated
It\'s all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life

Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack\'s what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes

Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said, "I\'m down with that"
Well, it meant you had the flu

I miss back when

Just a small reminder of the hell that I\'ve gone through
But look at me still smiling as I\'m wondering what I\'ll do
Since I ain\'t got nothing I got nothing to lose
Everybody say, "Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha"

Well my friends are always giving me watches, hats and wine
That\'s how I know this is serious, that\'s how I know it\'s time
I don\'t have to worry about things that I don\'t have
\'Cause if I ain\'t got nothing I got nothing to hold me back

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark

When I see your smile
Fill my soul again and I'm unbroken

If I doubted the power of love, baby, now I understand
I thank God for every day I wake up
To the soft touch of your magic hands
In this world sometimes the only thing that's real
Is the way you make me feel
