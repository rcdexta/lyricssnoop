Im feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be
When I look into your eyes
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter more like butter
Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

Boy you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking baby your the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning

We're getting close to danger zone
Show me how, tell me now, should I stay or should I go
'Cause I'm caught between yes and no

'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And it's tearing me all up inside

And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in
I try to run but there's no place to hide 'cause baby kisses don't lie

Kisses don't, no they don't, never don't lie

When I look into your eyes
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter more like butter
Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

Boy you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking baby your the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum

I want your time and your full attention
I wanna to talk to you and not to mention
Good love that you give to me
I think about it constantly

No I won't apologize
For feeling like I do
It's just the simple facts of life
I'm crazy over you

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what your giving me
Boy, it's killing me

When it comes to love I'm not trying share
You might think I'm greedy

And I'll put 'em in a letter 
And it might be easier 
The words might come out better 
How's your mother, how's your little brother,
Does he still look just like you? 
So many things I wanna know the answers to 
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line 
To the story of me and you 

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried 
To get you out my mind 
But it don't get no better 
As each day goes by 
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose

You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

S.O.S. please someone help me.

Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star

And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella

I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
