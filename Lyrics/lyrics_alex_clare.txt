[u"Waking up in someone else's bed
Was what I was waiting for
Oh my days, what have I done
She saw me sneaking out the door

What have I been waiting for
Been wasting all my time
Watching my youth slip away
Surely is a crime

And no, she don't know
What we do in our spare time
No, she don't know
That we've been up all night
All night, all night, all night

We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna
We gonna end up in the morning

...

", u"My heart just sank the moment I saw you
You're the image of a girl that I used to know
Don't be alarmed if it seems hard for me to explain
But every detail of your face makes me recall her name
Treading water, I keep treading water

Maybe it's another chance to mug myself again
Maybe it's another chance
I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way
Maybe it's another chance to mug myself again
...

", u"Relax my beloved, don't worry for me
Don't shed a tear for me, always be near for me
Be comforted my love, don't bow you head for me
Promise you'll smile for me, don't ever cry for me

You know these walls
They may fall down but I'll still hold on to you
At heights higher
Than you'd imagine me to

...

", u'You know I\u2019m not one to break promises
I don\u2019t want to hurt you but I need to breathe
At the end of it all, you\u2019re still my best friend
But there\u2019s something inside that I need to release
Which way is right, which way is wrong
How do I say that I need to move on
You know we have is separate way

And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There\u2019s nothing I can really say
I can\u2019t lie no more, I can\u2019t hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I\u2019ll be on my way
...

', u"Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
...

", u"Like a hummingbird in flight you are
Hovering, hovering near me
As I would need you to fly away, don't fly away
What can I say? You have to wait
I find it hard to say it articulate
I know that there's nowhere else you'd rather be
It seems so clear I know it true
...

", u"Care about no history
I just wanna go and raise a family with you
raise 'em true, raise 'em properly
I'm built for cover do it built for speed
And I wanna go fast so gimme what I need now
I bet you hear that all the time
I've been watchin' you sit in bed
And I wanna hold you near

Words are clever
Hands are better
So let's put them together
Do you want what I got
cause I need your company
If you doubt a thing that I say
Anytime you play your games on me

I'm gonna get you those precious things
like old brand whiskey and chicken wings
See that's a promise I can keep
...

", u"Life's a tightrope,
and your standing on one toe,
Don't let the fear take hold of you,
your bound to fall to the ground below,
Pick yourself up again,
over the edge again,
Hold on to your hopes and dreams,
When all seems to be lost,
don't start to count the costs,
just go and begin again,

tight rope walker, tight rope walker,

[Chorus:]
The only thing I'm sure of is to have no fear at all,
just go,
keep on rowing on,
...

", u'Whispering, whispering, whispering, whispering
As I pass myself down to my knees
Whispering, whispering, whispering, whispering
As I fall through the willow trees, and I said
Who will care for the fallen?
Who will care for the falling. leaves?
Whispering, whispering, whispering, whispering
As I fall through the willow trees, and I said
Who will care for the fallen?
Who will care for the fallen?

Autumn shades, calm my shaking hands,
...

', u'Though I left you there sleeping
No I dare not say a word
Silently weeping
Knowing what I heard
What can I say
I was never good with words
My tongue always got it wrong
Hoping that you knew all along
...
