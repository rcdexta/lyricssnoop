On the front lobe of my left side brains

The smell of you in every single dream I dream

Taking me places I ain't never been
But now you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

You triflin' good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill

I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Maybe this time, I'll be lucky
Maybe this time he'll stay
Maybe this time, for the first time
Love won't hurry away
He will hold me fast
I'll be home at last
Not a loser anymore
Like the last time, and the time before
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache in my bones
At the end I take home my hard earned pay all on my own -
I get down on my knees

If I could give you the world
On a silver platter
Would it even matter?
You'd still be mad at me
If I could find in all this
A dozen roses
That I would give to you
You'd still be miserable

'Cause in reality
I'm gon' be who I be
And I don't feel no fault
For all the lies that you bought
You can try as you may
Bring me down, but I say
That it ain't up to you
Go on and do what you do

Hate on me, hater
Now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad, baby
(Go 'head and hate)
Go 'head and hate on me, hater
'Cause I'm not afraid of
What I've gotta to pay for
You can hate on me

Ooh, if I gave you peaches
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

And even as I wander I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold dark winters night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger way over town
That digs on me

(She give me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' with no broke bro
(She give me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' with no broke bro

(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her under arm
She said I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far all those girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm and your arm
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
(No we haven't seen her)

(She give me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need)

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Oh, How about a round of applause, Yeah
A standing ovation
Oooooo, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry cuz you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
You really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I bust the windows out your car
And though it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now I don't care about that part.
I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you looking right at her
I didn't wanna but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cuz you had to learn

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd felt when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when
You see you can't just play with peoples feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

I bust the windows out ya car
You know I did it cuz I left my mark
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"[Rachel]
Don't know much about your life
Don't know much about your world
But, don't want to be alone tonight
On this planet they call earth

You don't know about my past
And, I don't have a future figured out
And maybe this is going too fast
And maybe it's not meant to last

But what do you say to taking chances?
What do you say to jumping off the edge?
Never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay
What do you say?
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here, the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone
'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
