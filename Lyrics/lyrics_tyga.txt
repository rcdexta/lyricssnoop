Big gulps, drink it all like a Slurpee cup
Brain freeze, ice like a hockey puck
London town, Westwood, what the f-ck is up?
Just checked my account, another hundred thou'
N-ggas sendin' me money like I'm PayPal
Wait pal, pow pow, 40 cal
Smith N Wessun, make a wrestler whistle loud
I'm in the grocery store, can't even walk the aisles
Ya girls see me, nah, I'm takin' pictures with a smile
Sunlight reflectin' off my gold skin
Last King killing everything you dressin' in
Blacks, Mexicans say, when your shit goin drop?
I tell em, Careless World probly goin' make the world stop
Vibrate your soul, make your p-ssy pop

Waking that old ass up like black people ringers

Filled of a world full of greed and hate
The world was my thoughts, and surroundings
I realized I needed to rise... and become king
My own destiny

Take a look around, tears from they eyes
Knees on the ground, money in the sky
Take a look around, ain\'t shit nice?
Praying for my life, hope I make it through the night

Take a look around, the city on fire
It\'s all taking place in the middle of my mind
I stand in the middle, cause death right beside
Murdering is simple, get your life simplified
Where the bones lie, rebuild another life
America\'s pie, put my hand in the pot
I can\'t get caught in the streets I was taught
Raised off anger, but it wasn\'t my fault
Nigga, take a look around, it\'s needles on the ground
Never gave three fucks, and I still don\'t now
I\'m fucking in the house, babysitter on the couch
Thirteen like, "What this shit coming out?"
Pass me a jimmy, I ain\'t ready for a child
I hope nobody hears: "Bitch, why you so loud?"
Turn on the tube, put my head on the cloud
Breathe, inhale, the angles can\'t help

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'I awoke from a dream
Filled of a world full of greed and hate
The world was my thoughts, and surroundings
I realized I needed to rise... and become king
My own destiny

Take a look around, tears from they eyes
Knees on the ground, money in the sky
Take a look around, ain\'t shit nice?
Praying for my life, hope I make it through the night

Take a look around, the city on fire
It\'s all taking place in the middle of my mind
I stand in the middle, cause death right beside
Murdering is simple, get your life simplified
Where the bones lie, rebuild another life
America\'s pie, put my hand in the pot
I can\'t get caught in the streets I was taught
Raised off anger, but it wasn\'t my fault
Nigga, take a look around, it\'s needles on the ground
Never gave three fucks, and I still don\'t now
I\'m fucking in the house, babysitter on the couch
Thirteen like, "What this shit coming out?"
Pass me a jimmy, I ain\'t ready for a child
I hope nobody hears: "Bitch, why you so loud?"
Turn on the tube, put my head on the cloud
Breathe, inhale, the angles can\'t help
Tyga, Take a look around

Take a look around

Take a look around, tears from they eyes

They say what don't break a nigga make a nigga
I woke up out my dream, said I gotta get it
This whole city full of thieves, gotta watch my pivot
Cause on the block, niggas never seen good living
Only lived in jail cells or prison
Drive bys, little homies hit the store for liquor
I gotta steer my life different, where to begin with?
Mama told me go back to school, I said I'm finished
There's only one way a nigga gonna learn:
You gotta take risks and do things the hard way
Stole the hall pass, now I'm running through the hallways
Only thing in my memory from those days
You couldn't save a nigga, even on a Sunday
Monday, new day, shit still the same
Gotta switch the rhythm up like Kwame
When things changed, watch people do the same

Just compare me to dope dealers and ballplayers

Levels of a professional
Skip school create my own lessons
Confessions of a mad rapper, music got me rapping

Green stretching only leads to red stretches
He's next in line for the blessing, get your mind off minds
Hustle something and stop relying on mine
More than a legend, why you letting time fly by?

At age seventeen addicted to ink
A rap fein who had money dreams
My chase of fame couldn't compare to what I seen
Them dyin', government lyin' hard for that paper cheese

Moms crying watching her only son through TV, MTV, BET
He goin' now, wipe me down
No longer fightin' through the crowd, I control the crowd
Oh, you like me now, wow

Would you forgive her and kiss her and tell her you love her
Or would you press it? 'Cause being the only child
Could leave you feeling desperate, in need of attention every second

But since you man of the house you never get it
Pops left without a smile but you never miss him
But when you reminiscing, you wished you had a father figure
At least weekend's man pay a visit, aw, forget it

What about lil' Jason up in prison?
You think an eight year old had bad intentions?
Pullin' the trigger on dad just barely killed him
Just wanted to protect moms from the brutal hittings

But he a kid so it's their word against his
Moms won't even testify scared of her husband
So he in for some years, don't even know what he did
But can't forget it now 'cause it's too late

We come to life when first class takes flight
Only sing the lines that make you press rewind
Even dealing with electric, I think that he regrets it now
Heart in light, dying love, everything looks better from above
You say it's getting old but I call it vintage love now
Don't regret it now

At a human's price trying to live that life
Can't slow down, don't regret it now
Determined by that dice, you only roll twice
You broke now, don't regret it now

Do us apart

Dated for only a month

How is this possible

potential and he is here to show it tonight.
Introducing Tyga Tyga.

Verse 1
Picture cash baby born how the duffle bag. How to ride
a moment don't make my temperature mad. Flickin' my
past admire all the shit that i had. Thinkin' I'm
really reppin' my city without a flag. Carry-ons,
earphones, MCM bag, elderlies mad as we all sittin'
first class. Look over shoulder laugh, family matter
chattin, did I do that? Imagine Erkel with a little
swag. Betty groaning already these bitches gettin' old,
fettichini flow, let my words twist around the folk.
Make you eat it like a dyke to a lesbian, oh, the lady

Smoke dawg baby, remember that shit.

[Tyga:]
Young light skinned, born?
Since I was 10 prolly name all the trouble I did.
Neva participated I'm like fuck all them other kids
Like I don't owe you child shit when I make it big
But a little respect,?
Never raised a gentlemen like Ne-Yo said.
Lookin for hero heads, but I don't see none yet.
All my friends weenin cigarette so I take a hit,
(cough cough)
That's some potent shit.
Ol' nigga police man, I ain't scared a shit,
But hell yeah I ran.
Lost my money clip ever since wrap rubberbands.
Biggity bam? skin made a couple of grands.
Fast forward to the 4th escort I ball?
Too quick 14 no license, that's some mar full shit
Now must stack ketchup like condenments
Kinda jss wish you taught me how to be a man. cuhs

[Chorus:]
Growin up all I wanted was a father figure
Me & mom alone every dinner.
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better.
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters.
If I sent my dad letters.
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters.

Uh, gotta find her.

[VERSE 1]
Stepped out, threw my diamond s sweater
On to the grocery, quarter eleven
The aisles with the beverages, 347
Seen two college chicks, why you gigglin?
I asked, they said "you be on television"
"Wait, your Tyga, my friend wants a picture"
So you live close by? Next thing I\'m looking in her eyes

Now that shorties in my bedroom saying "what should we do?"

I said "hey, don\'t slow it down"

Everybody in the party
Hold your cup high move your body
If you twist it, scream it loudly

Ay, ay, ay, hey
Ay, ay, ay, hey

Coconut juice got me real loose
Like, got me leaning three thousand proof like
Coconut juice all on the dance floor
Fellas let your ladies go, ladies let your fellas go

Come back, went straight to the club
Entrance, no charge, 'cause we late to the club
Yes, we don't stand in the club
GED on the couch pouring drinks on the rug

What a mess, but we cleanin' the club
Ice so bright make a fight scene in the club
Don't test, 'cause there's beams in the club
Red beams in the club leave your jeans full of blood

Coconut juice got me real loose
Like, got me leaning three thousand proof like
