Little Jimmy Jackson is jackin? up his Bronco
He? s gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
All the girls are getting pretty sprayin? on the White Rain
Yeah, they? re gonna get a rowdy tonight
Down at the football game, yeah

We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild, yeah, but that? s the way
We get down in a Hicktown

Well, you can see the neighbors butt crack nailing on his shingles
And his woman? s smokin?, Pall Mall? s watchin? Laura Ingalls
And granny? s getting lit, she? s headin? out to bingo
Yeah, my buddies and me are goin? muddin?
Down on Blue Hole Road, you know, you know

We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas

Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
It\'s another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin\' rays are wearing down his body

And diesel\'s worth the price of gold
It\'s the cheapest grain he\'s ever sold
But he\'s still holding on

He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer

He says, "Lord, I never complain, I never ask why
But please don\'t let my dream to run dry

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u'It\'s 3 AM and I finally say
I\'m sorry for acting that way
I didn\'t really mean to make you cry
Oh baby, sometimes I wonder why

Does it always have to come down
To you leaving
Before I\'ll say, "I love you"

And why do I always use the words
That cut the deepest?

I can barely think
With all of these thoughts
Running through my head
Wonderin' if I did you wrong
No way, I did you wrong

Every night, I try to justify
All the angry things I said
Oh but I can't take 'em back
No I can't do that
I was wrong, oh but now you're gone

I can't hide what I feel inside
And just stop lovin' you
Even if I wanted to

And I turned around
In a field of fireflies makin' such a lonely sound
As my headlights flashed on a mailbox by the road
I realized that I was livin' in a new zip code

Well I'm livin' in Lonesome USA
Population one since yesterday
Livin' and dyin' in the hell I made
Since you been gone
Right now my mind's in another state
Ain't enough heart here left to break
I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA

And I don't want to leave your side
For that lonesome road but here I go
Climbing back behind the wheel of
Fifty feet of chrome and steel and a load

Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go

I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart

For the last few years of my life
Working double overtime
While you sleep alone at night

Sometimes I forget to say I love you
But baby please know that I do, Yeah

CHORUS
I live this life everyday
I make my share of mistakes
And every lesson I've learned
I've learned the hard way
I do the best that I can
And i hope you understand

I wanna be there when you wake up,
Be more than just your friend.

As a funeral precession made its way
Through the gates
I watched it roll up a windin' road
Through the field of green
With whitehead snow's all in a row
And it made me think about where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
On the generation mostly undeserved
Blessings that I've had

Had an all american Mom and Dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
I can't believe this life is mind

And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
I'm good to go

Call me crazy and I may be
But I believe in ghosts

Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too.
Better watch out for the boys in blue.

There's only tow means of salvation
around here that seem to work
Whiskey or the Bible, a shot glass or revival

When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying
And I don't want to fall in, the same rut
That everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around

Baby, what you got goin' on Saturday?

You know, word's got it, there's gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four-wheel drives and big mud tires
Bus kits and wine

Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things

In that bed I said a little prayer for

From new York to Los Angeles,
Kinda making small talk killing time,

Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms,
Man it all looks the same,
Miles and miles of back roads and highways,
Connecting little towns with unknown names,

Met the men who plowed that earth,
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me,

Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?

Cannonball off an old rope swing

Climbed the water tower in Paris Tennessee

Wait out by the road I'm comin' to pick you up.

Found an old yearbook, flipped right to the page
Of that senior trip down there on that Panama strip
We all started yelling when we smelled the beach
Just couldn't wait to try our fake ids
We only had a few days, and a whole lot of memories to make
Oh man we were livin, didn't waste one minute
We talked and drank and danced and said goodbye
We laughed until we cried

Was sittin cross-legged 'round the Christmas tree

Is the life that you've chosen free from regret
Or it's what might've been just too hard to forget?
Has the glitter all faded? Do you get what you need?
Are you satisfied, baby, or do you wish it was me?

Could have been easier? Yeah.
A little smoother, right? Maybe so.

Would I change one thing about that road?
