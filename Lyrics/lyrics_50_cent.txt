This is how monster's function. 

Leave me aloneee. 
I ain' fuckin' with nobody. 

[Verse] 
Keep fuckin' with me you gon' turn me back to Boo Boo

Since high school, nigga I ain't got no friends 
Got two Three-Eighty's like the Ying Yang Twinz, Ahh. 
That's spot clickin' till the D's run in 
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees you got to have ends 
Freshman year I had that CBR Hurricane 
In a ill Herringbone I got 'um swingin' Heroine 
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump 
Then you can run Forrest run retard when I dump 
They take kindness for weakness, niggaz don't respect that 
So me I'm where that Reuger, that Pump and that Tech at 
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then 
Shit man, but you had like, twenty bricks in Richmond 
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreamin' 
We jus' got in the town, we was strapped up schemin' 
First Country caught a body, then country caught a body then

Come on Game you will never be my equal
Your homies shoot doors, my niggas shoot people

1!

1-2!

GRRR!



I had five hundred grams in fifty-fifty-eight bags

Four-hundred Benz eight-thousand in cash.

Then the ball dropped, GUN POPPED! - Bank$ got blast!

I make it so HOT! - One shot'll melt your ass!

GOT POPPED UP! - Probably till my eyes turned red

Told myself in the mirror nigga you ain't dead!

I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic

I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it!

When you see me in the hood - muhfucker don't talk to me!

'Less you wan' talk about usin' a Hawk for me.

When Al blew Black away I had 'em on some stupid shit

Then my rap shit WORKED! Now I'm super stupid rich!

All I do is stunt now! I'm so Maybach!

There I go frontin' again I meant to say laid back!

GO 'HEAD! Move wreckless get banged for necklace

I serve 'em with the Semi feed 'em a clip for breakfast.

I take grams of coke, mix it with lactose

In different boroughs I have different moments
On different days niggas know how I'm on it
I'm pretty like a Harlem nigga, I'm a shooter like a Brooklyn nigga
I'm a hustler don't get no bigger
Queens, SouthSide 'til they bury me
BX two tek's, flames out the nozzles
R1 One wheel, Christian Dior goggles

1!

1-2!

GRRR!



I had five hundred grams in fifty-fifty-eight bags

Four-hundred Benz eight-thousand in cash.

Then the ball dropped, GUN POPPED! - Bank$ got blast!

I make it so HOT! - One shot'll melt your ass!

GOT POPPED UP! - Probably till my eyes turned red

Told myself in the mirror nigga you ain't dead!

I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic

I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it!

When you see me in the hood - muhfucker don't talk to me!

'Less you wan' talk about usin' a Hawk for me.

When Al blew Black away I had 'em on some stupid shit

Then my rap shit WORKED! Now I'm super stupid rich!

All I do is stunt now! I'm so Maybach!

There I go frontin' again I meant to say laid back!

GO 'HEAD! Move wreckless get banged for necklace

I serve 'em with the Semi feed 'em a clip for breakfast.

[Intro] 
This is how monster's function. 

Leave me aloneee. 
I ain' fuckin' with nobody. 

[Verse] 
Keep fuckin' with me you gon' turn me back to Boo Boo 
Have me casin' out your crib, tryna pop your fuckin' noodles 
She was twenty I was twelve, man my Nana said she raped me 
I jus' smiled from ear to ear, sayin' take me baby take me 
Since high school, nigga I ain't got no friends 
Got two Three-Eighty's like the Ying Yang Twinz, Ahh. 
That's spot clickin' till the D's run in 
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees you got to have ends 
Freshman year I had that CBR Hurricane 
In a ill Herringbone I got 'um swingin' Heroine 
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump 
Then you can run Forrest run retard when I dump 
They take kindness for weakness, niggaz don't respect that 
So me I'm where that Reuger, that Pump and that Tech at 
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then 
Shit man, but you had like, twenty bricks in Richmond 
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreamin' 
We jus' got in the town, we was strapped up schemin' 
First Country caught a body, then country caught a body then

I'm so disrespectful, so, so, so disrespectful
I'm so disrespectful, so, so, so disrespectful

Your daddy fucked your mama then fucked your sister
Then climbed in the bed playin' with your sugar
Go 'head take your belt off and hang yourself
Matter a fact grab your strap and bang yourself

Jay's a big man, he's too big to respond
I'm a big dick you know the one everybody's on
You 'gon make me sing 'Murder Was The Case'
Pull this Richter shit ping, ping should you start to face

I'm international I'm never home, mayne
I've been gone so long my accent changed
You better watch who you fuck with mate
Or you 'gon make me carve your ass up now straight

Come on Game you will never be my equal
Your homies shoot doors, my niggas shoot people
See me I'm what you never 'gon be
I'm in that tax bracket you never 'gon see

When you cross me I'm so disrespectful, so, so, so disrespectful
See I get so disrespectful, so, so, so disrespectful
When you cross me I'm so disrespectful, so, so, so disrespectful

I can hear your heartbeat, your scared, yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat, your scared (x2)

You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I see, I come at night, boy, I kill you, you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry

[50 cent]
Look look, I've come from a different crew
You fuck with me, I'll get to you
A clip or two, I'll cripple you
'cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol poppin, a pussy drop
Drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie miney moe
Now try pow a 44
Pick a strap to take the mag
To hold and stab it in your back
I'll blow your brain, I know your name
And where you rest, I'll make a mess
The holla tipsy in ch-chest
Call for blood to EMS
Come pick you up
You know you fucked when
You get on a strecher
'cause I'll come in to ICU
To see you off to heaven
The system out I done been through
There's nothing new to me
They locked me up they let me out
You seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals
Why they up in corrections
They come home get at 9
and commit crime to perfection
It's murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint the shit's going terrific
He's so close to your target that it's really hard to miss it

You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy

I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me
Down
Through every altercation
I put no one above you, MM-MM I love you
They shook up when we jux 'em
You see how they be looking
It's frightening like lightning
You crack off, they start bookin'
It's beef until I get out
In broad day with my shit out
That's when they say I'm illing
And when she get to killing
Now my baby she precious
I warn you not to test this
I aim her at your head nigga
Motherfuck the vestes

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When the strap out you know what that 'bout
We do it my way 'cause a crime wave
Whoa, wave, whoa, wave

I wave the heat deep with my right to speak
Leave the clip y'all and talk shit y'all
Whoa, wave, whoa, wave

I'm not tellin' you to shoot somebody
But if somebody try to shoot you shoot 'em
Don't waste time, lil' nigga just do it
Any nigga out of order must be serviced

See now now you hesitatin' boy you makin' me nervous
The Feds know I clap heat felonies on my rap sheet
Front on me try to run from me hollows be up your back B
Pistol pop, dime for dime, burn, baby, burn
Revolver spinnin again and again you niggas never learn

Got a itchy, itchy, itchy, itchy trigger finger nigga
So if you hit me and you get me I'll be back to get ya
Man I might bring the homies in that's if it's necessary
See you might not be worried but I think you should worry

I take grams of coke, mix it with lactose
That's what I do, stretch
I make a ounce of dope with like a eighth of dope
Befo' I'm through, product stretch

I got it mastered man
In the hood I'm like plastic man, stretch
Fantastic man
I make the money come faster man, yeah

Your favorite bad guy's gone, the Joker's dead
So from now until forever you're stuck with the kid
I ain't supposed to be a boss, I'm supposed to be an enforcer
I'm supposed to hold a gun, not be stuck in the office

Michael pimped me? I was in the passenger seat
He was comfortable with me 'round 'cause I blast my heat
'9-4 I was tryin' to catch Mason for bricks of raw
Charlie fucked up the jux, they took Nana's little boy, stretch

The cocaine, I go hard when the drought come
When the straps come out son niggaz know the outcome
Lay low, stay low, you may see Jesus
Get hit with a stray yo for no fuckin' reason

You prayin' for a Benz, it's a blessin' you breathin'
It's a miracle that God gave me this Tec, now I'm eatin'
Cop it, chop it, profit is all for sale
Cocaine, 'Candy Rain', 'I'm Soul For Real', yeah

I take grams of coke, mix it with lactose
