A little country church on a two lane road
A bride and groom coming out the door
White lace dress and a red bouquet
Just married written on a blue Chevrolet

Don't that make you want to fall in love
Don't that look like a picture of us
A match made in heaven if there ever was

", u"If you don't get in the water, you're never gonna learn to swim
He said a snake is just as scared of you, as you are of him
He could tell by the moon when the fish would bite
Seems there was nothing that he didn't know
And as a kid I believed, 'cause grandpa told me so

He talked daddy into letting me have my first car
I thought I was really something till Becky Thompson broke my heart
That first taste of love nearly did me in
Getting over her was slow
And I knew someday I would, 'cause grandpa told me so

He said life was made for you to live
The best love is the love that you give
...

", u"Her long legs looked like trouble
As she sashayed through the door
And my mind flashed a warning sign
That I chose to ignore
For the prize I thought that I could win
The risk seemed mighty small
The bigger the fool, the harder the fall

I fell in love in the heat of passion
Oh, but passion has it's price
But under all that beauty
Beat a heart that was made of ice
God knows as far as I could see

With a little luck this ol' truck will get me home today
With a little more I'll still have this job tomorrow
Weather man says a wet weekend he just might be right
But rain or shine you'll be mine tonight

That's all I need to know
In a world where most things come and go
I'll always have you to hold
And that's all I need to know

", u'(Bob McDill)

If I quit my job for the simple life
Honey would you stand by me
If I bought a little cabin on a mountainside
Honey would you stand by me

Would you be my one true friend
Stick with me through thick and thin
If the roof was old and the rain came in
Honey would you stand by me

If I tried my luck in Hollywood
...

', u"Well, I got a little girl and she's got a daddy
Who's got a lotta money and it makes me happy
To follow them around like a little whipped puppy dog

Well, she's my honey but he's my sugar dad
This country boy ain't doin' too bad
Livin' high on someone else's hog

Well, I'm livin' high on someone else's hog
I sit around all day like a twenty-four karat
Bump on a golden log

Well, I traded that rusty old GMC
Got a long black Cadillac limousine

But I got enough girl for you and me

Gonna take you all the way to Paris, Tennessee

I wanna show you the Riviera
Got good tires and a good CB
Put on some lipstick your mascara

Saw a man in the movies that didn't have a heart
How I wish I could give him mine
Then I wouldn't have to feel it breaking all apart
And this emptiness inside would suit me fine

I wish I were a tin man
You could hurt me all you wanted

", u"Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan?
All I want for christmas is a real good tan.

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan,
take me to the Islands put my feet in the sand,
rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean.
singin Silent Night with the palm trees ablowin'.

Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan?
All I want for christmas is a real good tan.

Well, if you're thinkin' bout getting me a present this year,
let me put a bug in your cute little ear,
How bout two tickets to a tropical shore,
where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore,
instead of turkey we'll have mahi-mahi grill,
and Pina Coladas in the blender chillin'.

Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse sleigh, hey.

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh.

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making sprits bright

Of a place I love
Even more than I usually do.
And although I know
It's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas.
You can count on me.
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree.

Merry Christmas from Dixie, to everyone tonight
It's windy in Chicago. The kids are out of school

There wouldn't be no Santa Clause
Look what the store just brought
Thank God for kids

And we'd all live in a quiet house
Without big bird or a Mickey Mouse
And cool-aid on the couch
Thank God for kids

Thank God for kids there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile

Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And in every corner you'll hear

", u"Well, the news spread through Jerusalem
Tonight a child is born
There are shepherds falling to their knees
And angels blowing horns.

But in their golden halls the Pharisees
Scoffed and drank there wines
They said it's only Hebrew prophesy
We don't care and besides.

He's just a kid that's all He is
On more pebble in the gravel
One more rumour in the rabel
How can He be king, He's just a kid?

Well, in no time it seemed the world
Was knocking on His door
For miracles and wonders
...

", u"Slide on over baby
Underneath this mistletoe
Here's a toast to us together
Let me wrap you in this bow.

I'm in the Christmas spirits
No, this one won't be blue
It's gonna be the best one ever
And it's all because of you, baby.

You're The Angel At The Top Of My Tree
Best present anybody ever gave me
I got it decorated, all lite up, gift's underneath
...

", u'Kenny Chesney & Willie Nelson
Chorus:
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue.

Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh

All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and loved
Sleep in havanly peace

", u"There's a blue rocking chair
Sittin' in the sand
Weathered by the storms
And well oiled hands

It sways back and forth
With the help of the winds
It seems to always be there
Like an old trusted friend

I've read a lot of books
Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life
Where it's going, where it's gone

I've seen the world through a bus windshield
But nothing compares
To the way that I see it
...

", u"Man, I could use a Pina Colada
Little bit of sun on my skin
A hammock, a book, never gonna look back
Once my feet hit the sand
I've had it up to here with this rat race
Need a smile on my face

I wanna go where I can lighten up the load
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
Get this laying low off to a flying start

Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon
...

", u"Tired of my beeper, tired of my phone
Tired of this tired ol' tie I got on
Sick of this traffic jam that I'm in
We all get sick of it all now and then
When I've had it up to here
I go down there

To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer
When enough is enough
...

", u"He left Maine 'cause he needed a change
And he was desperate to rearrange priorities
And he thought the sea would be the best place to be
So he saved his money, sold his car
And with his eye set on a Southern star
He got the courage to follow his heart
Set out for a brand new start

He's an island boy
Now he's an island boy
Living his life where stress is the enemy
Now he's an island boy
A stone's throw from St. Croix
He's finally found his piece of serenity

", u"Stuck here at a Holiday Inn near Austin, Texas
Seen all the road that I want to see
God I hate the snow, they even cancelled the show
Makes me long for where I really want to be

Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke
Sipping on some Foxy's Firewater rum
Or kickin' back with Ivan
With all my friends down in the islands
Wouldn't take much for me to up and run
To another life somewhere in the sun

", u"She comes from Boston
Works at the jewelry store
Down in the harbor
Where the ferries come to shore
She never really knew how good it would feel
To finally find herself in a place so warm and real

She wears a Red Sox cap
To hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England
Is different now and dead
In all the local bars
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'
She's from Boston

", u'"There\'s something sexy about the rain"
She said as it came pouring down
It feels like kisses on my skin
She spread her arms and spun around

In a summer island storm
In a field of sugarcane
She taught me how and showed me why
There\'s something sexy about the rain

And sometimes it rained all night
And everything she did was perfect
And every way we were was right

We loved like there was no tomorrow
Then suddenly tomorrow came
And it was raining at the airport
And kept on raining on the plane
...

', u"Don't really know what day it is
Been rocking nine days in a row
All I know is it's hurricane season
And any minute she's gonna blow

I need a shave and I need some rest
I know some people are worried about me
But I'm french kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea

I can't remember what it is I think
And my, my, my, my key lime pie

Ocean breeze, tire swing
Coconut fall if you shake that thing
And my, my, my, my key lime pie

Not too tart, not too sweet
My baby loves to watch me eat
Her key lime pie
Her key lime pie

Tall green tree, yellow bird
Bikini bottom and a tie-dyed shirt
And my, my, my, my key lime pie

Slinging drinks at a bar down by the beach
And you know she came here from L.A.
Southern California could not hold her dreams
She's happy now it seems

'Cause Sherry's living, living in paradise
Chasing something or running from something
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing
And she's thought about leaving once or twice

So weak and tired,

From being up all night,
Prayin' she'd say yes.
So with a hopefull heart,

With a tear in her eye,
She looked at me,
It was the moment of truth,
I was scared to death.
My life hung on what that tear meant,
Then she smiled at me,
And I lost it.

(chorus)
No one can make me cry,
Make me laugh,
Make me smile,
Or drive me mad,
Like she does.

That is the cure,
Better or worse,
One things for sure,
It's real love,

And this old highway seems to understand
Leadin me on to somewhere that no one knows my name
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up
I'm doin all that I can to get my mind off us

Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard

Coconut oil, tan senioritas

Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away

Now I know how Richard Petty feels

You asked me if I love you
If I always will

It was over from the start, you completely stole my heart
And now you won\'t let go

Gonna knock on wood
Sweet sunshine everywhere I look

Everywhere, everytime our hearts meet, love is all around us
Every road we take, darlin love takes
Every turn, livin right inside us

With a basket full of chicken

Open up her throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face, she ain't foolin' me

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
while I'm chuggin' along

In a house where secrets go untold
Barefoot in a cotton dress, dark hair in a tangled mess
And a head full of crazy dreams

A place where the sun always shines
I'm goin to California
And I'm leavin everything behind

And rattled through the reeds, and the willow trees beyond
Daddy in his good hat, and momma in her Sunday dress
Watched with pride as I stood there, in the water up to my chest

And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood
I sank my toes into that, east Tennessee mud

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Getting to know everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing \u201cI Got You Babe\u201d by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night
...

', u"The body's a temple, that's what we're taught
I've treated this one like an old honky-tonk
Greasy cheeseburgers and cheap cigarettes
One day they'll get me if they ain't got me yet

'Cause I'm living, in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living, in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

My friends all grew up, they settled down
Built nice little houses on the outskirts of town
They work in their office, drive SUV's
They pray for their babies and they worry 'bout me
...

", u"Lookin' back now well it makes me laugh,
We were growin' our hair,
We were cuttin' class,
Knew it all already there was nothing to learn,
We were strikin' matches just to watch em burn.

Listen to our music just a little too loud,
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd,
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer,
It was a long train tressle but we had no fear,

Man I don't know where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that,
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes
...

", u"Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on forty nine
Man I can see the lights

School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile

And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
...

", u'When I was a boy

Four houses down from me
Was a family with an only child
She was the only girl
In this whole world that could make me smile

Down the road
I made up reasons to go
Down the road

Somewhere inside of me
There was something she took a liking to
And I asked her to marry me
And She said she really wanted to

Down the road
...

', u"Starin' out into the wild blue yonder
So many thoughts to sit and ponder
'Bout life and love and lack of 
And this emptiness in my heart

Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should I try to grow up 
But who knows where to start

So I just ...
Sit right here and have another Beer In Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another Beer In Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
...

", u'All he could think about was
I\'m too young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell I\'m just a kid myself
How \'m I gonna raise one

All he could see were his dreams
Goin\' up in smoke
So much for ditchin\' this town
And hangin\' out on the coast
Oh well, those plans are long gone

And he said
"There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all goodbye
There goes my life"

A couple years of up all night and
...

', u"Suntanned toes ticklin' the sand
Cold drink chillin' in my right hand

Watchin' you sleep in the evenin' light
Restin' up for a long, long night

'Cuz when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down, yeah

All day long just takin' it easy
Layin' in a hammock where it's nice and breezy
And sleepin' off the night before
'Cuz when the sun goes down we'll be back for more

When the sun goes down we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
...

", u"Walking along beneath the lights of that miracle mile
Me and Mary making our way into the night
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides, the pinball bells, and the skee ball slots
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight

There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the street
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hand
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet

And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be
Anything but mine

...

", u"Man, I could use a Pina Colada
Little bit of sun on my skin
A hammock, a book, never gonna look back
Once my feet hit the sand
I've had it up to here with this rat race
Need a smile on my face

I wanna go where I can lighten up the load
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
Get this laying low off to a flying start

Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon
...

", u'We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldn\u2019t do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

", u"When I feel that chill, smell that fresh cut grass
I'm back in my helmet, cleats and shoulder pads
Standing in the huddle listening to the call
Fans going crazy for the boys of fall
They didn't let just anybody in that club
Took every ounce of heart and sweat and blood
To get to wear those game day jerseys down the hall
Kings of the school man, we're the boys of fall

(Chorus:)
Well it's turn and face the Stars and Stripes
It's fighting back them butterflies
It's call it in the air, alright yes sir we want the ball
And it's knocking heads and talking trash
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass
...

", u"Stressed out, running late, racing down the interstate
Spilled hot coffee, down the front of my jeans
It's work, work, pay the rent, money and my time's spent
Not a minute left for me to be me

Been going like nothing can wait
I gotta get my priorities straight

I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot

...

", u"Tank top, love handles
Tube socks, Jesus sandals
Cheap blender, ice bucket
Raw oysters, yeah, give me one and shuck it

Holds up a frozen orange daiquiri and laughs
Here's to the boys at the factory

No more building transmissions
He's going deep sea fishing
Catch a marlin, catch a tan
Catch a local cover band

...

", u"Baby here I am again
Kickin\u2019 dust in the Canyon wind
Waitin\u2019 for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hell bent on gettin\u2019 high
High above the lights of town

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me baby
One is one too many
One more is never enough

...

", u"A Saturday downpour carved out rivers in the sand
She said it was her first time to see the sea
Helping her climb across those jetty rocks
Was the first time I touched her hand

The rain and the way that felt never let up all week
By Thursday I knew everything about her
And God, the last day I didn't wanna leave without her

The sidewalks, the streets were soaked
The sky was gray but you should've seen her face
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
And the way she called my name

I've lived those seven days a thousand times
Those seven days a thousand
...

", u'Honey, you think he\u2019s got an attitude
So you treat him just a little too rude
Buddy, you think she\u2019s a little too cold
So you act like a two year old

Don\u2019t it make you feel low, Joe?
Don\u2019t it make you feel mean, Jean?
Don\u2019t it make you feel ashamed of yourself?
Don\u2019t it make you feel small, y\u2019all?

Boy, you say something bad about her brother
Girl, you say something mean about his mother
Tempers flare and insults fly
And you\u2019re both wanting to die

Don\u2019t you feel like a jerk, Kirk?
...

', u"There's still marks on the pantry door of that little house
Where Mama used to measure us
I'm proud to say that's my home where I was raised
But that ain't where I grew up

See, I gained a little on Father Time
The summer my Granddaddy died
The first time I saw Mama cry
Man, that sure was tough

Felt like I put on a few years
Watching Daddy wipe her tears
In my little coat and tie standing in that cemetery mud
That's where I grew up

...

", u"For me it's a beach bar
Or on a boat underneath the stars
Or with my band up on a stage
For a while everything's okay

For some it's a fast car
Moonshine in a mason jar
And everybody has their way
Somehow to escape

Reality, yeah, sometimes life
Ain't all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
'Cause everybody needs to break free from reality, oh yeah
...

", u"Some folks livin' in the country can't wait
To get in their pick-up trucks and go to town
There's people living in a penthouse
Dying to get out in the sticks and ride around

There's a man above the mountain top
Wants to go down breath the salt air by the shore
There's a guy on an island, he ain't smilin'
Don't wanna be on an island anymore

There's a lady locked in a love affair
Wouldn't care if she was single again
There's a lonely soul who's only goal
Is to get that golden ring upon their hand

In the middle of nowhere where there's nobody
...

", u"If you're going out with someone new
I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

You said pick me up at three a.m.
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go
Somewhere with you, yeah

I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you
