Skies cock back and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping, acidic questions, forcefully
The power of suggestion, then with the eyes shut

Looking through the rust and rot and dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there
The memory won't escape me, but why should I care?

Detects the mesh of many elements compressed down

I've become so tired,
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do,
Is be more like me,
And be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
...

", u'God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
...

', u"I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you to just believe this is real
So, I let go watchin' you, turn your back
Like you always do, face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you are all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before, don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored, time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

...

", u"When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just because I know I can
But I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from you

No, no turning back now
I want to be pushed aside, so let me go
No, no turning back now
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
No, no turning back now
Anywhere on my own because I can see
No, no turning back now
The very worst part of you is me

I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
...

", u"Waking in a sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste
In my disgrace

Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place
There's no escape
I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?

Take this all away
I'm suffocating!
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me?
...

", u'In this farewell
There\u2019s no blood
There\u2019s no alibi
\u2018Cause I\u2019ve drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies

So let mercy come
And wash away

What I\u2019ve done
I\u2019ll face myself
To cross out what I\u2019ve become
Erase myself
And let go of what I\u2019ve done

Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
...

', u"Are you lost... in your lies?
Do you tell yourself I don't realize?
Your crusade's a disguise,
Replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives.
I'm aware of what you've done.

No, no more sorrow!
I've paid for your mistakes!
Your time is borrowed!
Your time has come to be replaced!

I see pain, I see need,
...

", u"I don't know who to trust, no surprise
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies

Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back upon my feet
All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

I take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
Because I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
...

", u"Jornada Del Muerto
I told you that you were mine
But then you decided to cheat on my ass right from behind
Jornada Del Muerto
You fucking cock sucking whore
I'll never have you clean my clothes
Or empty out my drawers
Can you seeeeeeee through me
All I want to do is hold you
...

With fists flying up in the air,
Like we\u2019re holding onto something
Thats invisible there,
Cuz we\u2019re living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear
Until we dead it, Forget it,
Let it all dissapear.

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It\u2019s out of my control\u2026.

Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid

Alone in this sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping

You take and take and take
And never say no

You got to get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
No
You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
Blackout
Blood in your eye

And said that I am mistaken

So don't apologize

Because once you have the theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And I am not a robot. I am not a monkey
