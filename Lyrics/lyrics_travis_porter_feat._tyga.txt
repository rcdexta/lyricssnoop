[u'Ok now ladies (Yeah)
If you know you bad (Yeah)
Don\u2019t need no man, got yo own bands, put up yo hands
If you a top notch bitch let me hear you holler
Bend it over (Yeah), 
Touch ya toes, whip it out (Yeah) 
show them hoes ya bank roll
Slang it out, hit a broke ho with it
Poke it out, Damn Shawty you can get it

If you got some good p-ssy say (YEAAAAH?)
If you got some good head on ya shouldeeeeers
If you got some good p-ssy say (YEAAAAH?)
If you never let a hoe f-ck you over
If you \u2019bout yo\u2019 check, drank Moet
Know the p-ssy stay wet, I need all dat
Tattoos on the back, I see all dat
You already got a man, I ain\u2019t tryna be all dat

I\u2019m just tryna hit it by the end of the night
Lil\u2019 mama so bad and her booty so tight
When I hit it from the back, don\u2019t fuss, don\u2019t fight
When I put it in ya mouth, don\u2019t scratch, don\u2019t bite
I\u2019m showin up, money I\u2019m throwin up
Liquor I\u2019m pourin up, go get you another cup
I told a shorty wassup, told her I\u2019m tryna cut
and then I slapped her dead on the b-tt
