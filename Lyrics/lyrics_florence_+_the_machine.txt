About my old school
And she was there all pink and gold and glittering
I threw my arms around her legs
Came to weeping
Came to weeping

And I heard your voice
As clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange
And so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night

And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was loose and I was set alight
But she came over me like some holy rite

And I\u2019ve been a fool and I\u2019ve been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I\u2019m always dragging that horse around

And our love is pastured such a mournful sound
Tonight I\u2019m gonna bury that horse in the ground
So I like to keep my issues strong

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

And all this devotion was rushing over me,

And the question to heaven, for a sinner like me,
But the arms of the ocean delivered me.

Though, the pressure's hard to take,
It's the only way I can escape,
It seems a heavy choice to make,
Now I am under.

And it's breaking over me,
A thousand miles onto the sea bed,
I found the place to rest my head.
...

", u"All alone
It was always there you see
And even on my own
It was always standing next to me

I can see it coming from the edge of the room
Creeping in the streetlight
Holding my hand in the pale gloom
Can you see it coming now?

Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down

...

", u"I\u2019ve been losin' sleep,
I\u2019ve been keepin' myself awake,
I\u2019ve been wandering the streets,
For days and days and days,

Oh if I\u2019m row to row,
Back to back,
Lover to lover,
And black to red,

But I believe,
I believe

There\u2019s no salvation for me now,
No space among the clouds,
And I\u2019ve seen that I\u2019m heading down,
But that\u2019s alright,
That\u2019s alright,
That\u2019s alright..
That\u2019s alright..

And I\u2019ve been taking chances,
I\u2019ve been setting myself up for the fall,
I\u2019ve been keeping secrets,
From my heart and from and from my soul.
...

", u"You want to hold my hand, you are the space in my bed
You are the silence in between what I thought and what I said
You are the night time fear, you are the morning when it's clear
When it's over you'll start, you're my head, you're my heart

No light, no light in your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light, no light, tell me what you want me to say

Through the crowds, crying out at me
In your place there were a thousand other faces
I was disappearing in plain sight
Heaven help me, I need to make it right
...

", u"Holy water cannot help you now
A thousand armies couldn't keep me out
I don't want your money
I don't want your crowd
See I have to tell you
You're a?

Holy water cannot help you now
See I've had to burn your kingdom down
And no rivers and no lakes can put the fire out
I'm gonna raise the stakes, I'm gonna smoke you out

Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in my house
See they were there when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done

Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
...

", u"Oh the river, oh the river, it's running free
And all joy, all the joy it brings to me
But I know it'll have to drown me
Before it can breathe easy

And I've seen it in the flights of birds
I've seen it in you
The entrails of the animals
The blood running through

But in order to get to the heart,
I think sometimes you have to cut through
But you can
You can
You can

...

", u'When we first came here,
We were cold and we were clear,
With no colors on our skin,
We were light and paper-thin.
And when we first came here,
We were cold and we were clear,
With no colors on our skin,
Til you let the spectrum in.

Say my name,
And every color illuminates,
We are shining,
And we\u2019ll never be afraid again.

Say my name!
As every color illuminates!
We are shining!
And we\u2019ll never be afraid again!
Say my name!
As every color illuminates!
We are shining!
And we\u2019ll never be afraid again!

And when we come for you,
...
