Money to the ceiling, tell me where my roof at.
Your pants too tight, maybe you just too fat.
Just a cheetoh with doritos, yea, I lay em like du-rags.
Boy, I know why you mad, cause my chain stoopid.

And your girl leaning all on me.
Imma give her a couple of drinks, then I put her ass to sleep.
Bedtime, if she come she a freak.
Then you read them headlines that she fucking with C.B.

What you mean? Imma ball out.
I\'m driving space ships, I threw my cars out.
What I call a garage, you call a house.

Money flying in the air,

See my main chick, she got that good shit,
And her gang vicious so I call her sid,

Have listened to it my girl

Kiss me soft and gently

Right then I stopped and thinking consequences
Guess I must\'ve lost my mind for a minute

Wanna meet her?

You might've seen her on every cover

", u"Chris Brown, Big Boi, yeah
Oh, she's mine and see, God knew she was mine
The day I seen that guy, the big mouth bass on the line
It\u2019s time for me to retrieve her and go get her like a wild receiver
But we don\u2019t play no ball, see, when they come through
You, baby girl, we\u2019re gon\u2019 take it all

On the real we need to nip this in the bud
\u2018Cause we kept it real with everyone
So tell me why they hatin\u2019, everybody's hatin\u2019?
It feels like they\u2019re just waitin\u2019 for us to grow apart

It\u2019s just hard for me to do
But baby, if I\u2019m your man I guess I gotta be your man
These men just gotta understand
Little girl with curves and hips, luscious lips
Girl, I can\u2019t front now, I\u2019m nervous

Hold up, can I take her out?
Hold up, uh, that\u2019s why I gotta tell you now

Now a days is so crazy out here, do you wanna [Incomprehensible]
If your daughter struts with me, lucky me
And you'd be lucky too, no entourage, no crew
Just me ridin\u2019 with my boo, I got her but don\u2019t think I\u2019m replacin\u2019 you

Girl, I know you know what I do and I\u2019m a major minor

That\u2019s gonna walk in my shoes and, girl, keep it one with you
...

Never seen before 

I said Yo, 
Tell her girls I want to meet her (meet her) 
On second thought that ain't the way to go 
I got to give her game proper 
Spit it so she'll get it 
There she is I got to stop her 

Or should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before) 
Or what about her style? (Too obvious) 
I'm out of time 
She's out the door 
I got to go for mine 

I think I'll say 

Yo

And I got to admit that you got my attention 
You're making me want to say yo 

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss

[Verse 1:]

3 A.M. when my phone ring begging me to come by
I was right around the corner
And I know I could\'ve said no
But I ain\'t stop
Told me "come in"
The door\'s unlocked for ya
My intuiton I should
Have listened to it my girl
Yo she\'d be pissed if she knew,
About this visit.
She had her tank top on
I took her tank top off
I should\'ve stopped, stopped
But she ain\'t let me
Kiss me soft and gently
She did me
Right then I stopped and thinking consequences
Guess I must\'ve lost my mind for a minute
[Chorus:]

There\'s no better love
Girl I love you
With her that was lust
And should\'nt have happened
I know I messed up
