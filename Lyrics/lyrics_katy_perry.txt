[u"I was living in a small mind with no lifeline
And no messages can reach me from the outside
When I looked out over the horizon
Didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising

Then it hit me, maybe bit me
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me
I didn't know exactly where I would be going
But I had to let this river in me flowing

What a ride
When you open your eyes
For the very first time
A real surprise

I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not

I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

...

", u"I've got people to see
Places to go
Deadlines to meet
A reputation to up hold
Its like a ton of bricks
Breaking on my back
Its like
The force of gravity
In full effect

I got money to burn
And im on the sake
They bet their bomb on me
Cause im their ace of spades

I feel the walls
Getting closer
Im like a bomb
With all red wires

All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
Im gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
Im gonna be

A diamond
It wont ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends a diamond
But there
...

", u"Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
You've got
Too much talent
I see you
Through those
Bloodshot eyes
There's a cure
You've found it

Slow motion
sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh, yes they will
They don't want
To define it
Just give up the game
And get into me
If you're looking
For thrills
Then get cold feet

Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing
In your pants
And your heart
On your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I fall deep
...

", u"I felt it
The wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter
I never saw it coming

I started to black out and
Then someone said good morning
I took it as a warning
I should have seen it coming

So now I'll take a chance on
This thing we may have started
Intentional or not I
Don't think we saw it coming
It's all adding up to something

That as of some involvement
That as for our commitment
I think I see it coming
If we step out on that limb

My heart beat, beats me senselessly
Why's everything got to be so intense with me?
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot and I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it

But I know if I don't take it
...

", u"This was big for us
Forever changing you and me
Allow me to be ambiguous
Though I can't stand ambiguity

I'll beat around this burning bush
Trying to put the fire out
When all the shoving came to push
The words just stayed stuck in my mouth

Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone
Ba da da dum

It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone yeah
Ba da da dum

So we might lose
But I'm glad I didn't leave
I wear my soul on my shoes
If not my heart upon my sleeve

If I'm not allowed to speak aloud
...

", u"You're such a poet
I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey
Sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You don't even need a rhyming dictionary
I wipe my hands on your jeans
Cause they are more distressed
So they say you've got a CD
And they claim you can barely read
But you say don't bother me with all of your reality

But it could be so simple
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just so simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

So what, you're a genius
But you've got a lot to learn
...

", u"What are you lookin' at?
(Yeah)

I saw this coming
From a mile away
I saw a crack
In the egg
A little rip
In the page

I found
Your necklace
On the floor
Underneath the bed
Where you said
I was the only one

You thought I'd cry
(You-thought-i'd-cry)
You thought I'd lay
Down and die
You thought
There's no
Hetting over you
(Ha-ha)

And all this time
(All-this-time)
You've been having
Your fun
I've been having
Some fun too

Cause' it
Takes one to know one
Congrats
You've met your match
You think I'd lie here
Heartbroken
But the knife
Is in your back
...

", u"I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like
No you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like
No you don't even like
No you don't even like\u2026

", u"Voted most likely
To end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting 'em down
'Cause $7.75
Isn't worth an hour of my hard work and time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh I'm worth more than an ex
More than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
Ohh I won't settle no oh 
Oh I can't settle

I wanna break the mold
Wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air 
I'm not going down with out a fight

(Chorus)
It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
...

", u"I saw a spider
I didn't scream
Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dog dare me, and
I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down
Cause they just get in my way

The way
You look at me is kinda like a little sister,
Rubbed by your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys
...

", u"You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hung-over and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID but you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks
Now don't blame me
You want to cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

...

", u"Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I pick the ripest one
I still got the seed

You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you, thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was 
Spending the night
Oh, I wish that I 
Was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
...

", u"Remember when I dove
into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee
under my skin
a mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken
And my heart is still wide open

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

With each scar there's a map
that tells a story
...

", u"I leave the gas on, walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning, I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and running all the red lights
Did I get your attention? 'Cause I'm sending all the signs

That the clock is ticking and I'll be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black you'd best prepare a speech
Say something funny, say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me

I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure, we're going down for sure
...

", u"I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high but looking so low

Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends

Oh oh oh, have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
...

", u"Remember last summer, 
under the shooting stars?
We made a wish were together forever, 
And let nobody tear us apart.

And how fun was that ride down to Mexico?
We took a chance on those road side tacos,
and we got sick by the side of the road. 

And the fall came, 
and we had that big pot lot party; 
and your little sixteen year old brother, 
spilt wine all over my carpet. 
and I got mad, you thought it was funny, 
I stayed mad all winter;
It's so sad, 
A thing like that, 
Becomes such a splinter.

I tried it your way, 
but I got nothing to show.
It's been the same, same, 
and the story's getting old. 
...

", u"This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

In one ear

I saw you talkin' to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen

BUt I will wait for you
As long as I need to
...

", u"Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I pick the ripest one
I still got the seed

You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you, thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was 
Spending the night
Oh, I wish that I 
Was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
...

", u"I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high but looking so low

Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends

Oh oh oh, have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
...

", u"You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hung-over and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID but you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks
Now don't blame me
You want to cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

...

", u"The weight of my words
Are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves but you won't hear a thing
Cause I've dug myself deep
I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach

In one ear
And out your other
So lock and key
You won't open up for me

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving giving up

...

", u"I saw a spider
I didn't scream
Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dog dare me, and
I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down
Cause they just get in my way

The way
You look at me is kinda like a little sister,
Rubbed by your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys
...

", u"This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

", u"How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute
How will I know the right way to love you

Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down the man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you

I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knockin' on wood
Hopin' there's a real boy inside

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel
That my love is real
But you're not a man

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
...

", u"I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like
No you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like
No you don't even like
No you don't even like\u2026

Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch, I would know

And you over think
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up 
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

The cherry on top,
The pick of the pack,
The cr\xe8me de la crop,
If you want me you better do better than that tonight
Oh, oh

If you want me,
It takes more than a wink,
More than a drink,
More than you think,
If you want me you're gonna have to break the bank tonight

\u2018Cause some don't have the patience,
Some call me high-maintenance
But you pay the bill,
\u2018Cause that's the deal,

If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check,
For me, for me,
Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,

into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee
under my skin

It brings back the memories

Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted

These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

that tells a story
