[u"I am smoking on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he\u2019s, not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye
Louie V\u2019s in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block-ow, dope enough to go in yo nostrils
I take ya girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead ass rappers
It's probably one these pussy ass niggas, don\u2019t try me I\u2019ll pull that trigga
Got ya car note in my cup, and your rent in my swisha
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game\u2019s so vicious
And all I get is cheese like I\u2019m taking pictures

I say fuck you, \u2018less I\u2019m wit\u2019 ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don\u2019t do
Nah I just do it for the niggas
That try to see a million \u2018fore they die
