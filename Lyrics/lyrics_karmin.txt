Don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour
Oh oh, I can't seem to let you go

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight

Called you out, finished strong

That's how it is, ain't no riddle
Crunchy on the edge but fast in the middle

Play it real slow, lean on the bow

"So hold your head up, girl and you\'ll go far,
listen to me when I say."

I\'m beautiful in my way,
\'cause god makes no mistakes
I\'m on the right track baby
I was born this way

Don\'t hide yourself in regret
Just love youself and you\'re set
I\'m on the right track baby
I was born this way

Ooo there ain\'t no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Ooo there ain\'t no other way
Baby I was born -
I\'m on the right track baby
I was born this way

Don\'t be a drag, just be a queen
Don\'t be a drag, just be a queen
Don\'t be a drag, just be a queen

Give yourself prudence and love your friends.

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"This is more than a typical kinda thing
Felt the jones in my bones when you were touching me, oh oh
Didn't want to take it slow
In a daze, going crazed, I can barely think
You're replaying in my brain, find it hard to sleep, oh oh
Waiting for my phone to blow

Now i'm here in a sticky situation
Got a little trouble, yep and now I'm pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
Don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour
Oh oh, I can't seem to let you go

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio
...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"This is the last time you say
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday
Nothing to celebrate-brate-brate...

You give a hundred reasons why
And say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for everytime
I'd overbank

Thought I was the exception
I could rewrite your addiction
You could have been the greatest
But you'd rather get wasted

You fall asleep
during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take
are more your fort\xe9
I'm not sticking around
to watch you go down

Wanna be your lover
Not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior
I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and
watch your circle to drain
Watch your circle to drain
Watch your circle to drain

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Who do you think you are, a super STAR?
Who do you think you are, you can kiss my oh my gah!

All eyes on you tonight
So let's toast to you, you got so much to prove
And you say, everyone's got a price
That's how you get your way if not there's hell to pay

You're gonna huff and puff and blow the whole house down
Don't they know you're the king of the castle
The nerve of some people
To think we're all equal
911 it's me to the rescue
If I don't speak who's gonna tell you
Oh yea I gotta let you know

CHORUS

I'm here to crash your party
You think you're the star of the show
But I'm about to let you know
I'm here to crash your party
The bigger you are the harder you fall, oh you had it all
Before I crashed your party

...

******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like,
Forget you!
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like,
Forget you!
And forget her too!

Yeah baby I'm sorry, i can't afford a Ferrari,
But that don't mean i can't get you there.
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari,
But the way you play your game ain't fair.
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(oh she's a gold digger)
Well, just thought you should know 
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like,
Forget you!
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like,
Forget you!
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some sh*t?
